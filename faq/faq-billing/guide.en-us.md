## Objective

Here are the most frequently asked questions about billing and payment for your OVHcloud services.

### What is my billing account?

You can view a list of contacts for your services in the `My contacts`{.action} section, accessible directly in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

For further information about contact management, please read this detailed guide: [Managing contacts for your services](https://docs.ovh.com/us/en/customer/managing-contacts/).

### How do I change my billing details?

Your billing details are the same as your NIC handle (Customer ID). For upcoming bills, simply update this information in the `My account`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

For legal reasons, you cannot change an invoice that has already been issued. If, however, your request is linked to an error on our side, please contact us by creating a support ticket.

### How are my services renewed?

By default, your services are renewed automatically when they reach their renewal date, and your bill total will be debited at the beginning of the month from your default payment method. Please ensure that you save a payment method on your customer account to avoid any of your services being suspended. If you want to cancel your services, please ensure that you do so BEFORE the expiry date.
For certain ranges (domains, web hosting plans, VPS and dedicated servers), you can choose a manual renewal method.
If your services are set to be renewed manually, you will be sent notifications by email when your service reaches its expiry date, with a link to pay online.
If you do not renew your service before this date, it will simply be suspended, then deleted after a few days.

#### Tips and tricks

Check the status of your services, and manage their renewal in the `My services`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.
Log in and manually renew your services on the page <https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/order/renew.cgi>
For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Managing renewal for your services](https://docs.ovh.com/us/en/billing/how-to-use-automatic-renewal-at-ovh/).

### How do I enable automatic renewal?

Go to the `Products and services`{.action} section, accessible via the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel. Click on the three dots next to the service concerned, and select `Enable automatic payment`{.action}.

#### Tips and tricks

Before you enable automatic renewal, please enter a payment method. Please be aware that if payment is not settled after 7 days, your services will be suspended as a result.

Once you have received your order from us, if your mandate has been approved, you can then use this new payment method.
