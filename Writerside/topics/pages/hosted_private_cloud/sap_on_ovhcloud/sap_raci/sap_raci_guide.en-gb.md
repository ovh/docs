## Objective

The RACI below details the division of responsibilities between OVHcloud and the customer for SAP on OVHcloud solutions. This model can help the customer get the most out of SAP on OVHcloud solutions. It supplements the [Dedicated Servers RACI](dedicated-servers1.) that applies to the SAP HANA on Bare Metal service, and the [VMware on OVHcloud RACI](responsibility-sharing1.) that applies to the SAP HANA on Private Cloud service. The acronym "SLES4SAP BYOL" is used for "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications Bring Your Own License".
