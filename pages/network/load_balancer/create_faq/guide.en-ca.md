## How do I configure my Firewall to accept traffic from the OVHcloud Load Balancer?
When using the Load Balancer, your clients do not connect directly to your servers. A good practice is to setup a firewall to allow only traffic from the OVHcloud Load Balancer service.

- To determine which IPs to allow in your firewall, you can use the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /ipLoadbalancing GET /ipLoadbalancing/{serviceName}/natIp
> 

## How do I know the status of my service?
Sometimes it may be useful to know the status of your OVHcloud Load Balancer.

- To determine the status of your service, you can use the following API call :

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /ipLoadbalancing GET /ipLoadbalancing/{serviceName}/instancesState
> 

The different statuses of the OVHcloud Load Balancer can be `running`{.action} (Active), `reload`{.action} (Refresh in progress), `unknown`{.action} (Not yet started), or `dead`{.action} (inactive).

## How to add an Additional IP to the OVHcloud Load Balancer?

- To add an Additional IP to an OVHcloud Load Balancer service :

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /ip POST /ip/{ip}/move
> 

- Apply the change :

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /ipLoadbalancing POST /ipLoadbalancing/{serviceName}/refresh
>
