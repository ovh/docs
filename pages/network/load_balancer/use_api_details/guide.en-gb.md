## Objective

Description of the different input points in the API for the Load Balancer OVH.

## Prerequisite

## In Practice

### Manage your Load Balancer OVH service via the API

Details of the API functionality for the Load Balancer OVH

- All API calls are made in the section */ipLoadbalancing* available here : [https://api.ovh.com/console/#/ipLoadbalancing](https://api.ovh.com/console/#/ipLoadbalancing){.external}.

> [!warning]
>
> Caution, for compatibility reasons, the entry point of the former
> system Load Balancer OVH is always present in the API /ip/loadBalancing,
> not to be confused with the new /ipLoadbalancing.
> 

> [!primary]
>
> In the calls below all fields marked with an asterisk *
> are mandatory.
> 

> [!primary]
>
> The Frontend, Farm and Server are specific to the
> protocol (among HTTP, TCP or UDP) in which they are defined.
> Although they can be "combined" with each other, this is only possible within
> of the same protocol. Thus, it is not possible to use a Frontend
> UDP with an HTTP Farm. But it is possible (in the absence of other
> limitation) to use an HTTP Frontend with an HTTP Farm.

### Routes HTTP
Routes are evaluated one by one, testing their routing rules. The first route validating all its rules sees its action executed, and stops the evaluation of the remaining routes. The order of execution is defined by the type and weight of the route.
