## FAQ

### What should I do if I experience any difficulties logging in to the Help Center or the ticket management interface?

If you are having trouble connecting to our support center or ticket management interface, the following issues may be the cause:

- You have entered an incorrect password.
- Cookies are not enabled on your browser.
- You are trying to connect from a different country than your billing country.

Here are some solutions to try:

- **Password**: Check that you have entered the correct password or reset your password using [this documentation](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password#lost-password).
- **Cookies**: Make sure to enable cookies on your browser.
- **Billing country**: Try connecting using one of the two appropriate gateways based on your location and billing country:
    - [European Union (EU)](https://help.ovhcloud.com/login_with_sso.do?glide_sso_id=5e9c81e66886e8901e111f908472f1e2)
    - [Canada (CA)](http://help.ovhcloud.com/login_with_sso.do?glide_sso_id=e6292c24e02bb050476bf14567ec5ef1)

If the problem persists, please contact our assistance team for help.

#### Tips and Tricks:

If you have trouble connecting to the OVHcloud Control Panel, you can also try connecting using one of the following two gateways:

- European Union (EU): <https://www.ovh.com/auth/>
- Canada (CA): <https://ca.ovh.com/auth/>

This may solve some login problems.

### What should I do if I can't reach support by phone?

To avoid waiting on the phone, please create a support request via the [OVHcloud Help Centre](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm?id=csm_get_help). Click on the button `Create a ticket`{.action}.

You can also refer to our documentation (FAQs, guides, diagnostic tools, etc.) in the [Help Centre](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-gb-documentation?id=kb_home).

### Why has the ticket creation form changed?

The aim of this new form is to make the ticket creation process more comprehensive and accurate, with a questionnaire. This means we can classify your requests more efficiently in accordance with the service type, your support requirements, and how critical they are. It also avoids time-consuming back-and-forth between you and our teams.

### How can I send documents and other files to the OVHcloud support?

You can transmit files in these formats (max. size: 1024 MB): bmp, cap, csv, eml, gif, jpeg, jpg, pcap, pdf, png, txt, xml, yaml, yml.

Create a support request in the [OVHcloud Help Centre](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm?id=csm_get_help) and attach your files.

### Where can I find my support level?

The level of support linked to your NIC handle is listed on the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel, below your initials. If you have not signed up to a paid support service, you will have the Standard level by default.

### Why has OVHcloud changed its customer support?

OVHcloud has done this to enhance the experience it offers. Our new support structure is designed to meet growing customer expectations, with quicker replies to questions and even higher service quality.

This is why OVHcloud is now offering a wider, more accurate support system that suits business needs, and provides customers with access to online autonomous management services.
