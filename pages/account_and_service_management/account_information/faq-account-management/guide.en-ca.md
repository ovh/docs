## Objective

Here are the most frequently asked questions about managing your OVHcloud account.

### How do I create an OVHcloud account?

Creating an account is free and simple. Your account is designed to give you easy access to your information, and help you manage your services. To create an account, [click here](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca).

You can also secure access to your personal information by enabling two-factor authentication. You can do this by going to "My account", then "Security". For further information on how to keep your account secure, read the "How do I secure my account?" section below.

#### Tips and tricks

You can’t find your country? Change the website language by clicking on the flag of your choice in the top right-hand corner.

### Where can I find my OVHcloud username?

Your username or customer ID — also called a NIC handle — is located in the top right-hand corner of your last invoice. It looks like this: “ab00001-ovh” (the first letters are normally the initials of the person who created the account). This username is also included in all emails sent by OVHcloud (account creation confirmation email, order confirmations, renewal emails, etc.).

If you have not yet found your username, you can click on the “Forgotten your username or password?” link on the login page for your [OVHcloud account](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca), and enter the email address associated with your account.

#### Tips and tricks

When you are logged into the OVHcloud Control Panel, you will find your username in the top right-hand corner, next to your name.

### What do I do if I can't log in to my customer account?

For various reasons — such as forgetting your password, losing access to your email address, or to your mobile phone for an SMS identification — you may not be able to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel.
If this happens to you, please follow [this guide](/products/account-and-service-management-account-information#login-failure), which is designed for resolving situations like this.

### How do I change my personal information?

To view or change your personal details, log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel with your login credentials. You can access your personal information by clicking directly on the initials for your first name and surname, in the top right-hand corner of your dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel. Next, go to the “My profile” section of this page.

#### Tips and tricks

Want to change the email address for your OVHcloud account? A confirmation request will first be sent to the email address you currently have listed in the OVHcloud Control Panel. If you can no longer access this email address, you will need to wait 24 hours. After this period, the change will automatically be made.

### How do I add my telephone number correctly on my account?

Your telephone number needs to be entered in its international format.

### Tips and tricks

For "07123456789", please enter "+44 7123456789". The "+44" is automatically added if you select United Kingdom as your country of residence.

#### Tips and tricks

If you can no longer access the contact email address, please follow this [procedure](https://www.ovh.ca/support/procedures/).
If you have forgotten your username, you can find it in the top right-hand corner of your last invoice. It is sometimes referred to as a NIC handle, and resembles the following: “ab00001-ovh”. (the first letters are normally the initials of the person who created the account). This username is also provided in the confirmation email when you create your account, as well as in emails confirming or renewing an order.

### How do I change contacts?

You can delegate the administrative, technical and billing management of your services to other OVHcloud customer accounts from the OVHcloud Control Panel. To do this, go to the “Contact management” section, accessible from the banner on the right.

The service delegation must be validated via email both by the service administrator and the new contact.

Before you make any changes, please ensure that all contact email addresses are valid, otherwise the request will not be successful.

If you would like to retrieve a domain name that you are the registered owner of from the registry (you can check this information on [www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/tools/check_whois.pl](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/tools/check_whois.pl)), but you do not have access to the administrator customer account, please follow this procedure: [www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/procedure/procedureChangeContacts.cgi](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/procedure/procedureChangeContacts.cgi)

#### Tips and tricks

A full contact management guide is available here: [/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts#access-contact-management](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts#access-contact-management)

### How do I set and change a billing contact?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel with your login credentials. Go to the dashboard and click on the “Contact management” shortcut, in the banner on the right.

#### Tips and tricks

For further information about contact management, please read this detailed guide: [Managing contacts for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts).

### How do I secure my account?

You can choose from several solutions to secure your account, such as:

- choosing a complex password
- regular renewal of this password
- two-factor authentication

For two-factor authentication by sending a code via SMS or through IP restriction (authorisation or refusal of access to certain addresses), you can add security rules from your Control Panel. These options are all available in the “Security” section, after clicking on your initials in the top right-hand corner of the OVHcloud Control Panel Dashboard.

And for more info, watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odO58c4gJfc&list=PL0DynEzr_sE5MnOfJOpVJN-EhfMDWoqGS&index=24).

### How do I enable two-factor authentication/2FA on my OVHcloud account?

After you have created your OVHcloud customer account, we recommend securing your personal data by enabling two-factor authentication. To do this, please go to the “My account” section, then “Security”. To enable 2FA, you can use several authentication options:

- By SMS, via a security code
- From a mobile application compatible with Android, iPhone and Windows mobile
- Using a U2F-compatible security key

For further information, please refer to our [guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/secure-ovhcloud-account-with-2fa).

### How do I disable two-factor authentication/2FA on my OVHcloud account?

If you would like to disable the two-factor authentication method you have set up, please log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, go to the “My account” section, then “Security”.
You can then disable the various security devices one by one. 
However, if you no longer have access to the OVHcloud Control Panel because you have lost your two-factor authentication device, please contact OVHcloud support so that an advisor can manually disable the device. They will request supporting documents from you in order to proceed with this.

### What do I do if my OVHcloud account has been hacked?

If your OVHcloud account has been fraudulently used (identity, payment method, etc.), we strongly recommend filing a complaint as soon as possible with your local police force.

Once you have filed it, you will need to send us a copy of the documentation. We can then start our internal processes.

Your NIC handle (Customer ID) will then be blocked. Services that were fraudulently ordered will be deleted and automatically refunded.

Finally, in order to regain control of your customer account, we may ask you to change your email address and/or password via this link: [www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/en/procedure/procedureChangeEmail.cgi](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/en/procedure/procedureChangeEmail.cgi)

### I have received an email that appears to be a phishing scam impersonating OVHcloud, how do I report it for verification?

To identify and report a phishing email or SMS, please refer to our [dedicated guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/phishing_care)

### How do I report abusive behaviour or illegal content from services hosted by OVHcloud that I am a victim of?

You can report any abusive behaviour or illegal content on the dedicated OVHcloud platform [www.ovh.com/abuse/](https://www.ovh.com/abuse/). Select the category concerned, then enter the fields requested.

Only logs and technical elements can be sent to the owner of the service concerned. Please do not include any personal data in these fields.

### After abuse has been reported, what happens to my report?

Your report will be processed as soon as possible by OVHcloud’s legal team. Your complaint will be analysed, and we will provide you with further details. If any of our customers’ abusive behaviour is proven, we will inform you and take the necessary measures with the people concerned to put an end to it as soon as possible.

### OVHcloud has sent me an email flagging potential abuse from my services, what should I do?

If abusive behaviour has been reported to us or detected by our teams, you will receive an email from an email address with the following format: ticket+"ticket-number"@abuse.ovh.net.

In view of the additional information provided to you in this email, we will ask you to conduct an investigation in order to stop the abusive behaviour and/or remove any illegal content.

To ensure that your services are not being controlled by a third party (e.g. following a hacking incident), we recommend checking that your services are secure:

- [Secure your OVHcloud account and manage your personal information](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/all_about_username)
- [Change your account password](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password)

- [Secure a VPS](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/secure_your_vps)
- [Secure a dedicated server](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/securing-a-dedicated-server)

### If abuse is detected on one of my OVHcloud services, how can I avoid a suspension?

Once you have carried out the required actions yourself, you will need to reply directly to the email sent to you by our Abuse team, specifying the measures you have taken.
A member of our team will reply as soon as possible.

### I replied to the OVHcloud Abuse team, but my service is still blocked. What should I do?

From the OVHcloud Control Panel, you can open a support ticket to OVHcloud Customer Service for further information on how to process your Abuse ticket. To make your request easier to process, please ensure that you include the reference to this Abuse ticket in your support request.

### How do I delete my OVHcloud account?
