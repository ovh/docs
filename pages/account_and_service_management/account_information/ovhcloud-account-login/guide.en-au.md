## Objective

Your services are managed mainly via the OVHcloud Control Panel.

**Find out how to log in to your OVHcloud account and how to resolve login failures.**

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud account](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/ovhcloud-account-creation)
- knowing the OVHcloud account security [best practices](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/all_about_username)

## Instructions

### Logging in to the OVHcloud Control Panel

Go to the [OVHcloud login page](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au){.external}, enter your primary email address and password.

If you have enabled [two-factor authentication](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/secure-ovhcloud-account-with-2fa), you will then need to enter the unique connection code generated by your device (phone, tablet or U2F key).

### What do I do if I can't log in? <a name="login-failure"></a>

The rest of this guide will give you methods for resolving common cases of failed connections to the OVHcloud Control Panel.

### I have lost my password

If you have lost or forgotten your password, please follow [this guide detailing the steps to take in order to change it](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password#if-you-have-forgotten-your-current-password).

### I have lost my password and my primary email address is no longer valid

In this case, the password reset procedure cannot be performed from the login page.

If you have entered a backup email address, you can contact the OVHcloud Customer Service (dial 1300 OVH AUS (684 287)) so that this backup address becomes the primary email address.

Once this action has been completed, please [enter a **new** backup email address](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/all_about_username#backup-email) in your account settings.

### Two-factor authentication is active on my account but my phone has been stolen

In this case, you can: 

- use two-factor authentication emergency codes ;
- use another device ;
- disable two-factor authentication.

Please refer to our guide on [Securing your OVHcloud account with two-factor authentication](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/secure-ovhcloud-account-with-2fa#what-do-i-do-if-i-lose-one-of-my-devices-or-if-it-stops-working) for the appropriate steps.

### I have not enabled two-factor authentication on my account, but I am still being asked for a code

For security purposes, even if two-factor authentication is not enabled on your account, you may be asked to provide a verification code to validate your identification.

This code will be sent to **the primary** email address you entered for the account.

If you cannot find this code, please check your spam folder.
