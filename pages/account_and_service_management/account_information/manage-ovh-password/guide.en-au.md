## Objective

Your OVHcloud Control Panel password is required to access all of your services and information. It needs to meet a set of complexity requirements, and it must also be changed regularly to guarantee security.

**Find out how to set, change and manage your password.**

## Requirements

- an active OVHcloud account
- your NIC handle and/or email address

## Instructions

### Generate a strong password

To ensure that your solutions stay secure, you will need to set a strong password for accessing the OVHcloud Control Panel. To ensure that your data is secure, it must meet the following criteria:

- It must contain at least eight characters.

- It must contain at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, and one number.

- It must contain special characters (e.g. %, #, :, $, \*).

- It must not contain a dictionary word.

- It must not contain any personal information (e.g. your first name, surname or date of birth).

- It must be stored in a password manager.

- It must be changed every three months.

- It must be different to any passwords that have been used before.

There are several effective ways of creating strong passwords. We recommend following the tips provided by the National Cyber Security Centre: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email

The freemium password manager LastPass also offers a tool for creating solid, randomly-generated passwords, available [here](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator){.external}.

### Use a password manager

You can use specific software programs to save and secure your OVHcloud account password.

For example, you can use the password manager **KeePass**. It is a free, open-source, popular password manager.

It is simple to use, and involves setting a master password — which must meet a complexity requirement — then using the master password to access a database containing all of your usernames and passwords. You can make the passwords stored in the database highly complex, because the software program will store them.

The software can also generate random complex passwords, which it will save for all of the websites and applications you use.

### Best practices for password management

- **Check that it has not been compromised.** Ensure that your current password has not been accessed by malicious parties. You can check this on the **Have I Been Pwned website**.
If your password has been compromised, we strongly recommend [changing it as soon as possible](./#change-your-password).

- **Use a separate password for each service.** The password for accessing your OVHcloud account should not be used on any other websites or applications. We also recommend applying this rule to all of your web services. By using a different password for each website, you can avoid having all of your services compromised with just one password theft.

- **Don’t save your password in your web browser.** Although it can be very practical, we do not recommend allowing your password to be saved by your browser via the “Remember this password” box.  This can result in several security issues, especially if a malicious person manages to take control of your computer. They would simply need to retrieve the file containing the list of saved passwords, and they would then have access to your accounts.

- **Change your password regularly.** By changing your password on a regular basis, you can increase your account’s security. If you suspect that it may have been compromised, change it immediately. When you reset your password, all active sessions for your OVHcloud account will be automatically closed. Please also ensure that the password you set is different to the previous passwords you have used.

- **Keep it secret.** Passwords should stay secret. They should not be written down, shared with other users, or sent to third-parties. OVHcloud teams will never ask for your password, especially not via email.
