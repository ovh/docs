Once you have created your account, you will automatically be logged in to your accountâ€™s dashboard.

### What is my NIC handle?

Each OVHcloud customer account is associated with a unique ID, also called a NIC handle.

It is usually made up of two letters followed by numbers, for example: **xx11111-ovh**.

Your NIC-handle is what you will need to use in order to:

- place orders online
- manage all of your services easily via the OVHcloud Control Panel
- identify your customer account when you contact OVHcloud support, so that they can answer your queries.

Your NIC handle is displayed in the top right-hand corner under your name and email address.
