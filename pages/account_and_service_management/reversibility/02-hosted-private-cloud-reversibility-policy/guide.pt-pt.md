title: Hosted Private Cloud Reversibility Policy (EN)
updated: 2021-05-05
---

## Objective

This document is the reversibility policy for the [Hosted Private Cloud Premier Powered by VMware](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pt/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) product.

This policy aims at implementing the global reversibility principles and requirements of [SWIPO IaaS Code of Conduct for Cloud Providers](https://swipo.eu/download-section/copyrighted-downloads/){.external}.

## Features map

Hosted Private Cloud features are divided into three categories:

- The [core features](#core-features) for which we guarantee the ability to migrate
- The [OVHcloud implementation](#ovhcloud-implementation), whose migration will require adaptations to a new environment.
- [Specific functionalities](#specific-functionalities), whose migration as such is impossible to guarantee as they are tied to OVHcloud environment or specific developments.

### Core features <a name="core-features"></a>

|Feature|Description|Available formats|
|---|---|---|
|Software-defined Compute|Set of virtual machines managed by VMware vSphere|Every file format supported by vSphere, such as .vmsd, .vmx ...|
|Software-defined Storage|Set of datastores attached to virtual machines.|N/A|
|Software defined Network|Network virtualisation service based on NSX|N/A|

The following migration models and available documentation apply to all the features described in the table above.
