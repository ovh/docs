title: Public Cloud Reversibility Policy
updated: 2021-05-05
---

## Objective

This document is the reversibility policy for the Public Cloud [Compute](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/compute/), [Object Storage](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/object-storage/) and [Block Storage](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/block-storage/) activities.

This policy aims at implementing the global reversibility principles and requirements of [SWIPO IaaS Code of Conduct for Cloud Providers](https://swipo.eu/download-section/copyrighted-downloads/){.external}.

## Features map

Public cloud features are divided into three categories:

- The [core features](#core-features) for which we guarantee the ability to migrate
- The [OVHcloud implementation](#ovhcloud-implementation), whose migration will require adaptations to a new environment.
- [Specific functionalities](#specific-functionalities), whose migration as such is impossible to guarantee as they are tied to OVHcloud environment or specific developments.

### Core features <a name="core-features"></a>

### OVHcloud implementation <a name="ovhcloud-implementation"></a>

|Feature|Description|Available formats|Migration model|Available documentation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Public image catalog|Catalog of classic system images, optimised by OVHcloud|qcow2|Setup new instances using a similar offer on another provider|N/A|

### Specific functionalities <a name="specific-functionalities"></a>

### Architecture listing

All components of Public Cloud products are accessible through the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager). This allows to visualize and manage the instances, volumes, object containers ... as well as the features that are attached to these components.

Horizon webUI also allows to view architecture components.

### Partner services

OVHcloud Partners are listed with the "Cloud Migration" keyword in the dedicated [directory](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en/directory/).

### Cost and fees

No additional billing is planned from OVHcloud for the migration features listed here.

### Retention of data after contract termination

On object storage, the data is retained 7 days after the termination of the service and then deleted permanently.
