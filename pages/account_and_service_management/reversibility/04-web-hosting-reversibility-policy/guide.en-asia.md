title: Web Hosting Reversibility Policy
updated: 2021-05-05
---

## Objective

This document is the reversibility policy for the **Web Hosting** product for the [domain name](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/domains/) activity.

This policy aims at implementing the global reversibility principles and requirements of [SWIPO IaaS Code of Conduct for Cloud Providers](https://swipo.eu/download-section/copyrighted-downloads/){.external}.

## Features map

**Web Hosting** features are divided into three categories:

- The [core features](#core-features) for which we guarantee the ability to migrate
- The [OVHcloud implementation](#ovhcloud-implementation), whose migration will require adaptations to a new environment.
- [Specific functionalities](#specific-functionalities), whose migration as such is impossible to guarantee as they are tied to OVHcloud environment or specific developments.
