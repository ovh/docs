**This guide explains how to manage your services and their renewal via the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## The different types of renewal

**Click on the tabs below.**

> [!tabs]
> **Automatic renewal**
>>
>> When you subscribe your services, they are set to **automatic renewal** as the default mode. This ensures that your services are systematically renewed when the subscription expires.
>> Example: You subscribed to a Web Hosting plan on 15 January 2024. It will be automatically renewed on 15 January 2025 and the amount corresponding to its annual subscription will be debited from your default payment method.
>>
>> If you have registered a payment method in the OVHcloud Control Panel, it will be used to pay for your bills automatically.
>> If you have not registered a [payment method](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods), you will be sent an invoice via email. You will then need to pay it via an online form.
>>
>> For services with an automatic renewal frequency higher than 1 month (3 months, 6 months, 12 months), you will also be sent an email reminder the month before, listing the services that will need to be renewed soon.
>>If you do not want to extend one of these services, you just have to [cancel it in your OVHcloud Control Panel](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_cancel_services).
>>
>> **Warning**: The absence of a payment method in your account does not trigger an automatic cancellation of your services. To cancel services, please read our guide on [Cancelling OVHcloud services](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_cancel_services) .
>>
> **Manual renewal**
>>
>> If you do not want automatic renewal and therefore direct debit, you can change the renewal type for certain products (Domains, Hosting plans, VPS, Dedicated Servers) and switch them to **manual renewal**.
>>
>> This renewal method may be useful if:
>>
>> - You are not sure whether you want to keep the service after its expiry date.
>> - You do not want your bills to be debited automatically from your payment method.
>>
>> If you choose manual renewal, you will receive several reminders by email before the expiry date, each containing a link to renew services online when they expire.
>> You can also pay via the OVHcloud Control Panel.
>>
>> **Warning**, if you do not pay for a service that is renewed manually, it will be **suspended** on its expiry date, then **deleted** after a few days.
>> However, if you do not wish to keep this service, you do not need to request its cancellation.

## FAQ

> [!faq]
>
> I am asked to enter an account ID and password when I want to anticipate payment for my service. What is the account ID?
>> The username, account ID or NIC handle is your OVHcloud customer ID, which is in the form of **xx11111-ovh**. The password requested is the password for accessing your OVHcloud account. If you have forgotten it, set up a new password by following [these instructions](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password).
> Where can I find my OVHcloud customer ID?
>> It is displayed in the OVHcloud Control Panel by clicking on your name in the top right-hand corner. It is also listed in the top right-hand corner of all your bills. It is also included in the account creation confirmation email, order confirmation emails, renewal emails, and account login notifications.
> I can't log in to my OVHcloud account to renew my services. What should I do?
>> Refer to the [What do I do if I can't log in?](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/ovhcloud-account-login#login-failure) section of our guide “[Logging in to the OVHcloud Control Panel](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/ovhcloud-account-login)”.
> I want to enable automatic renewal, but I get an error message. What should I do?
>> To enable automatic renewal on your services, you must have added a valid payment method to your OVHcloud account. If this is not the case, or if the payment method has expired, an error message will appear in the OVHcloud Control Panel when you try to enable automatic renewal. Please refer to our guide on [Managing your payment methods](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods) to add a payment method or check the current method's status.
> My payment method has expired. How do I add a new payment method?
>> Refer to our guide on [Managing your payment methods](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods). Before you can delete an obsolete payment method, you will need to add a new valid payment method into your OVHcloud account.
> I forgot to renew my domain name in time, what should I do?
>> Start by checking the domain name’s status using the [WHOIS domain name tool](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/domains/whois/).
>> If it is a generic domain name (.com, .org, .net, etc.), it remains reserved for a "grace period" (approximately 7 days), followed by a "redemption period" (approximately 35 to 40 additional days). These delays vary, and depend on the extension and the rules of the registry that owns the extension. During these two periods, only you will be able to renew the domain name.
>> During the grace period, you can renew it via the OVHcloud Control Panel by following the steps in this guide.
>> During the redemption period, the domain is no longer managed by OVHcloud. Renewal via the OVHcloud Control Panel will incur an additional fee (this will vary depending on the extension).
>> After the redemption period, the domain name will enter a deletion phase that can take several days, before becoming public again. If you would like to use it again, we recommend using the [WHOIS domain name tool](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/domains/whois/) to check its availability regularly.
> I do not want to renew my domain name, but transfer it to a registrar other than OVHcloud. How do I do this?
>> Follow the instructions in our guide “[Transferring a domain name to another registrar](/pages/web_cloud/domains/transfer_outgoing_domain)”.
> I no longer want to pay by direct debit, but I do not want to cancel my service. What should I do?
>> If your service allows it, you can use the [Configure renewal](#actions) action and choose a manual renewal.
> I have renewed my service for 12 months. Can I change my mind?
>> Once a service has been renewed, this renewal cannot be cancelled. You can still choose another renewal type or cancel the service, but these 2 options will only be taken into account at the end of the current subscription, i.e. after the 12 months.
> My website is suspended because I did not renew my services in time. I just did a renewal of my services. How long do I have to wait for my website to be accessible again?
>> The recovery time will vary depending on the services concerned.
>> If only your Web Hosting plan was suspended and renewed, you will need to wait an average of 2 hours for your website to be accessible again.
>> If your domain name was also suspended and has been renewed, the delay may be longer, and may take up to 48 hours, corresponding to the DNS propagation delay.
>> To protect your critical services from becoming inaccessible, we recommend to prioritise automatic renewal and to [check regularly that your payment methods are up to date](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods).
> My service subscription expires in July 2024. It's January 2024, and I want to renew it for another year. Will the subscription then expire in July 2025 or January 2025?
>> When you extend the renewal period for a service (for 1 year or a shorter period), this period is added to the next date of effect shown in the "My services" table. In your case, your service will be renewed until July 2025.
> My service subscription expired on January 1st 2024 and I forgot to renew it. I have just renewed it on January 16, 2024, for six months, but I note that it will expire on July 1, 2024, and not on July 16, 2024. Is that normal?
>> Yes, it is normal, the renewal starts on the expiry date of the subscription.
