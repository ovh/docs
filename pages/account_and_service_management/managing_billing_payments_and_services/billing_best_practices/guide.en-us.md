## Objective

This guide contains the essential elements for managing your account and the billing of your OVHcloud services.

**Find the best practices to adopt in order to avoid any service interruptions or irregularities in your OVHcloud account.**

## Requirements

- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- Active OVHcloud services in your OVHcloud account 

## Instructions

### Account settings

#### Account security

[Create a strong password](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password#generate-a-strong-password) which will ensure your OVHcloud account's privacy.

[Enable two factor authentification](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/secure-ovhcloud-account-with-2fa) to prevent any fraudulent access.

For the security measures to be efficient, make sure your email addresses (main and backup) and your mobile number are **up-to-date and accessible**.

#### Personal information

Your personal information (postal address, email address, etc.) must be up-to-date in your customer account to guarantee the security and proper functioning of your services.

Check your personal information by clicking on your name in the top right-hand corner of the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), then on your initials (`Manage my account`{.action}).<br>
In the `My profile`{.action} section on the right of your screen (click on your name again to remove the left menu), click on `...`{.action}, then on `Edit my profile`{.action}.

Ensure your email address is always **up to date, accessible and secured**. Email messages from our services will be sent to this address, including the ones meant to reset your Control Panel's password.

#### Automatic renewal

> [!primary]
>
> In order to prevent any service interruption and for the good functioning of the autorenewal, [register a payment method](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods) in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
>
> Check regularly that your payment method is **valid**.

- [Managing payment methods](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods)

If you decide not to activate the autorenewal on your services, you will receive notifications prompting you to make a **manual payment** to either renew your service in advance or pay your pending bill.

### Order follow-up

Did you know that you can [track your orders](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/managing_ovh_orders) in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)? <br>
Just navigate to the `Dashboard`{.action} tab at the top menu of your screen, then click on `View my orders`{.action}.

### Service termination

If you want to stop using one of your services, you can either cancel it, set its renewal to manual mode or delete it immediately through your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

First click on your name at the top right of your screen, then on `Products and services`{.action}. On the right side of your screen, click on the `...`{.action} button corresponding to the service you want to act on, then click on one of the following buttons:

- `Configure renewal`{.action}: On the following screen, you'll be able to switch the `Renewal type` of your service to `Manual`. Then click on `Next`{.action} and `Confirm`{.action}. Before the expiration date of your service, you will receive several notifications by email. If you don't renew your service, it will be **permanently** deleted.
