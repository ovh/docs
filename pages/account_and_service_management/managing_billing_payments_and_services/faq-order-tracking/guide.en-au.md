## Objective

Find the most frequently asked questions about OVHcloud order tracking.

### How do I pay for a new order?

You can only pay for your order once you have logged in to your customer account. Simply select a payment method that you have already saved to your customer account, or add a new one. If you pay by bank card, your bank may send you a confirmation code via SMS, which you will then be asked to enter during the payment stage of your order. Once the payment has been received by OVHcloud, you will be notified when it has been processed, and when your order is complete.

#### Tips and tricks

Have you left the order page? You can view your order and pay for it in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), via the `My orders`{.action} section.

### How do I check my payment status?

First of all, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager). Next, go to your dashboard and click on the `Invoices`{.action}  shortcut in the banner on the right. If an invoice is due, you will be offered the option to pay the balance directly in the dashboard.

#### Tips and tricks

You can save your payment method in the `Payment methods`{.action} section. This way, your invoices will be paid for automatically.

### How do I track the status of my order?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, then look at the dashboard in the centre of the page to see the status of your most recent orders. If you would like to access all of your orders, click `View orders`{.action}.

#### Tips and tricks

We have created a [detailed guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/managing_ovh_orders) to help you manage your orders.

### How do I change my order?

Orders cannot be changed. However, If you do not pay, your order will automatically be cancelled.

#### Tips and tricks

If you have already paid for your order, please contact our [customer service team](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/contact/).

### How do I cancel my order?

If you do not pay for an order, will automatically be cancelled after 24 hours.

As a private customer, if you have already paid for your order and it is not linked to a custom service (e.g. a domain name) or a licence (e.g. Office 365), you can retract your order within 14 days. If you need further information on this, please refer to our [detailed guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/managing_ovh_orders#apply-the-right-of-withdrawal) on this topic.

#### Tips and tricks

As a business customer, please note that you are not covered by the introductory article of the French Consumer Code, which includes a right to retract within 14 days.

### Why has my service not been delivered?

Your order might be delayed for a number of reasons.

In order to protect its customers, OVHcloud takes particular care to ensure that financial transactions are secure. As a result, a random payment validation process has been set up, and it may slow down your order. To find out if this affects you, you can check your payment status in the `Billing`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

Another potential reason may be that you have a bill pending payment. If this is the reason, please pay your balance via the `Billing`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

You can save your payment method in the `Payment methods`{.action} section, so that it is used for future orders and automatic payments.
