## Objective

If your Private Cloud offer no longer suits you, or if you have ordered a new infrastructure to replace the old one, you can request the termination of this infrastructure, once all your data is secured.

**Find out how to cancel your Private Cloud offer.** 

## Requirements

- a [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/)
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

The Private Cloud offer is without obligation. However, as laid out in the [Special Terms of Service](https://www.ovh.co.uk/support/termsofservice/Special_Conditions_for_Dedicated_Cloud_2014.pdf){.external}, any month that has begun is due and payable in advance.

>[!warning]
>
> Before cancelling your offer, please be careful to retrieve all the data you wish to keep. Indeed, termination will result in the complete deletion of your Private Cloud and all the data it contains.
>

### Step 1: Request termination from the OVHcloud Control Panel

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager){.external}, go to `Hosted Private Cloud`{.action} (1), click on `Private Cloud`{.action} (2) and select your offer from the list (3).

In the "Service management" section of the "General Information" tab, click the button `...`{.action} (4) to the right of the renewal date. Finally, click on `Delete the service`{.action} (5).

Please be aware that this action will remove any data on the infrastructure as soon as the termination is confirmed. No pro rata refund will be made if the infrastructure is terminated before the end of the month.

### Step 2: Confirm termination

Following your request, a termination confirmation email is sent to you at the address linked to the OVHcloud account.

You can also find this email in your OVHcloud Control Panel. Click on your name at the top right and then on `Service emails`{.action}.

The subject of the email is:

> **Deleting your Private Cloud "pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx"**.

The email contains a clickable link that will allow you to confirm the termination of your offer.

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that this link is valid for **72 hours**. We therefore advise you to make your request for termination from the 25th of the month.
>

You can also validate the termination request through the following OVHcloud API:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud POST /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/confirmTermination
>

You will then need to fill in the validation token available in the termination confirmation email.
