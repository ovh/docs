## Objective

With the *cloud credit* option you can allocate a specific amount to your Public Cloud project which will serve as the default payment method for the [billing of the project](/pages/public_cloud/compute/analyze_billing).<br> This means that cloud credit is debited first and any outstanding amount will be then be paid by other available payment methods. (Please consult the [Public Cloud billing guides](/products/account-and-service-management-managing-billing-payments-and-services) to learn more about this topic.)

**This guide explains how to add credit on to your Public Cloud account using a voucher, or by generating a purchase order.**

## Requirements
