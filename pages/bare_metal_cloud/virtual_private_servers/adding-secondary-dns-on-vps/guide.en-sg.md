title: Configuring OVHcloud Secondary DNS on a VPS
excerpt: Find out how to add a secondary DNS server for your domain
updated: 2022-01-12

## Objective

If you are configuring your VPS as a DNS server, you can make use of the OVHcloud Secondary DNS service to host a secondary zone. This way, DNS for your domain will remain available even if the primary DNS server should become unresponsive.

**This guide explains how to add your domain name in the OVHcloud Control Panel in order to utilise an OVHcloud Secondary DNS server.**

## Requirements

- A domain name to which you have administrative access
- A [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/vps/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg)

> [!warning]
>OVHcloud is providing you with services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. You are therefore responsible for ensuring they function correctly.
>
>This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend that you contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/directory/) if you have difficulties or doubts concerning the administration, usage or implementation of services on a server.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieving the validation code <a name="retrievecode"></a>

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg), go to the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section and then select your server from **Virtual Private Servers**.

Switch to the tab `Secondary DNS`{.action} and click on the button `Add a domain`{.action}.

A message will be displayed in your Control Panel regarding the verification process.

It is necessary to confirm your authorisation to manage the domain name before it can be added to OVHcloud Secondary DNS. This is achieved via an automated DNS lookup on the subdomain *ownercheck.yourdomainname*. An individual string of characters is generated for this purpose and displayed inside the red notification box. Copy this validation code for use in the next step.

### Step 2: Verifying authorisation for the domain name <a name="verifyingdomain"></a>

The required action is different, depending on where the DNS of your domain name is managed.

- If the domain name is managed by an external registrar **or** it uses external DNS servers at this point, log in to the control panel of your DNS provider and add a DNS zone record of the type TXT with the subdomain "ownercheck" and the value provided by executing [step 1](#retrievecode).

- If the domain is managed by OVHcloud as its registrar **and** it uses OVHcloud DNS servers, add the TXT record in the `Web Cloud`{.action} section of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg). You can follow the instructions in our [DNS zone guide](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit) if you are not familiar with this process.

### Step 3: Adding the domain name

As soon as the TXT record is present in the domain name's DNS zone, repeat the [steps described in the first part of this guide](#retrievecode) to add the domain name to the OVHcloud Secondary DNS server.

Clicking on `Confirm`{.action} will trigger the automatic owner verification by querying the TXT record. A message in your Control Panel will confirm the successful DNS check. You can now delete the TXT record.

Added domain names will be listed in this tab with the corresponding **name of the secondary DNS server**. (Refresh the page in your browser after adding a domain name.)

Domain names can be removed by clicking on the `...`{.action} button in the table.

> Other actions required to configure your own DNS for your domain name(s) usually include:
>
> - Configuring a DNS service (such as *BIND*)
> - Configuring GLUE records
> - Authorising zone transfers

> Please refer to the corresponding manuals and external knowledge resources if you need further instructions for these administrative tasks.
