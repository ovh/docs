title: Configuring the firewall on Linux with iptables

## Objective

Your VPS is equipped with a firewall. Firewalls create a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.
Firewalls work by defining rules that govern both authorised and blocked traffic. The firewall utility developed for Linux systems is *iptables*.

**Find out how to secure a server with _iptables_.**

Nevertheless, we recommend that you contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/directory/) and/or discuss the issue with [our community](https://community.ovh.com/en/) if you face difficulties or doubts concerning the administration, usage or implementation of services on a server.

## Requirements

- A [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/vps/) in your OVHcloud account
- Administrative access (root/sudo) to your server via SSH

## Instructions

> [!primary]
>
> This guide lists the commands for an Ubuntu Server distribution.
>
> This guide is for general use. You may need to adapt some commands depending on the distribution and/or operating system you are using. Some tips may suggest using third-party tools. If you have any questions about their use, please refer to their official documentation.
>

### Step 1: Update your system

Distribution and operating system developers offer frequent software package updates, very often for security reasons. **Keeping your distribution or operating system up-to-date is essential for securing your server.**

Please refer to our guide on [securing a VPS](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/secure_your_vps) for more information.

### Step 2: Install the iptables firewall in Ubuntu

> [!primary]
>
> There are two different versions of *iptables*, for IPv4 and IPv6. The rules we cover in this Linux *iptables* tutorial concern IPv4.
> To configure *iptables* for IPv6, you must use the *iptables* utility. These two different protocols do not work together and must be configured independently.
>

*iptables* is installed by default on most Linux systems. To confirm that *iptables* is installed, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables
```

The example output in Ubuntu confirms that the latest version of *iptables* is already present:

Typically, an *iptables* command is as follows:

```bash
sudo iptables [option] CHAIN_rule [-j target]
```

Here is a list of some common *iptables* options:

- -A --append: Adds a rule to a string (at the end).
- -C --check: Finds a rule that matches the requirements of the string.
- -D --delete: Removes the specified rules from a string.
- -F --flush: Deletes all rules.
- -I --insert: Adds a rule to a string at a given position.
- -L --list: Displays all rules in a string.
- -N --new chain: Creates a new string.
- -v --verbose: Displays more information when using a list option.
- -X --delete-chain: Deletes the supplied string.

### Step 3: Check the current status of iptables

To display all of the current rules on your server, enter the following command in the terminal window:

```bash
sudo iptables -L
```

The system displays the status of your channels.<br>
The output will list three strings:

### Step 4: Allow traffic on localhost

To allow traffic from your own system (the *localhost*), add the input string by entering the following:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```

This command configures the firewall to accept traffic for the localhost (lo) interface (-i). From now on, everything that comes from your system will pass through your firewall.
You must set this rule to allow applications to communicate with the localhost interface.

### Step 5: Allow traffic on specific ports <a name="step5"></a>

These rules allow traffic on the different ports that you specify using the commands listed below.
A port is a communication endpoint specified for a specific type of data.

To allow HTTP Web traffic, enter the following command:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

To allow only inbound SSH (Secure Shell) traffic, enter the following (note that we use the default SSH port number 22. If your port number is different, make sure to adjust the commands accordingly):

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

To allow HTTPS Internet traffic, enter the following command:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

The options work this way:

- -p: Checks the specified protocol (tcp).
- --dport: Specifies the destination port.
- -j jump: Performs the action. 

> [!warning]
> If you lose access to your server, you can always use the KVM/IPMI tool to access it again and modify your configuration or delete your rules.
>
> For more information on accessing this tool, please refer to [this guide](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/using_kvm_for_vps).

### Step 6: Control traffic by IP address

Use the following command to accept traffic from a specific IP address.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s your_IP_address_to_authorise -j ACCEPT
```

Replace the IP address in the command with the IP address you want to authorise.

You can also block traffic from an IP address:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s your_IP_address_to_block -j DROP
```

Replace the IP address in the command with the IP address you want to block.

You can reject traffic from an IP address range with the following command:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m iprange --src-range your_start_IP_address-your_end_IP_address -j REJECT
```

The *iptables* options we used in the examples work as follows:

- -m: Matches the specified option.
- -iprange: Instructs the system to wait for a range of IP addresses instead of one.
- --src-range: Identifies the IP address range.

### Step 7: Delete unwanted traffic

If you are defining *iptables* firewall rules, you must prevent unauthorised access by removing all traffic from other ports:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

The -A option adds a new rule to the string. If a connection goes through ports other than those you have defined, it will be discontinued.

> [!warning]
> 
> If you type this command before performing [step 5](#step5), you will block all access including the current one, SSH access. This is particularly problematic on a machine you access remotely. 
>

### Step 8: Delete a rule

A more precise method is to delete the line number of a rule.

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP 
```

First, list all rules by entering the following:

```bash
sudo iptables -L --line-numbers
```

![line-numbers](images/Step7-all-rules.PNG){.thumbnail}

Locate the line for the firewall rule you want to remove and run this command:

```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT <Number>
```

Replace `Number` with the rule line number you want to delete.

### Step 9: Save your changes

When the system is restarted, *iptables* does not keep the rules you created.
Whenever you configure *iptables* on Linux, any changes you make apply only until the next reboot.

To save rules to Ubuntu-based systems, type:

```bash
sudo -s iptables-save -c
```

The next time your system boots, *iptables* will automatically reload the firewall rules.

You can now configure basic *iptables* firewall rules for your Linux server.
Feel free to experiment because you can always delete the rules you don't need, or empty all the rules and start over.
