## Objective

OVHcloud has combined all of its Kimsufi, So you Start and Rise dedicated servers into a new product line called Eco, to give you a better overview of our configurations. Due to these changes, you can now manage all of your services, across all ranges, from the OVHcloud Control Panel. To support you in this change, if you have opted to purchase products from the Eco line, we have set up a guide that will introduce you to the OVHcloud Control Panel and its options.

**This guide is designed to help you familiarise yourself with the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

> [!warning]
> Please note that despite the interface change, the options available for your server range will remain the same. Some options may not be available for Kimsufi and So you Start servers.

## Instructions

### Dashboard

If you have pruchased servers from the Eco product line, your dashboard will now be the one in the OVHcloud Control Panel. The OVHcloud dashboard provides a summary of all your services. This interface has several sections that allow you to access a service instantly.<br>
The right-hand column gives you access to your personal information, NIC handle and support level (if applicable). It also provides a set of shortcuts and useful links.
