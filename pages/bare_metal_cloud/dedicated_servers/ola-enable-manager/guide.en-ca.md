## Objective

OVHcloud Link Aggregation (OLA) technology is designed by our teams to increase your server’s availability, and boost the efficiency of your network connections. In just a few clicks, you can aggregate your network cards and make your network links redundant. This means that if one link goes down, traffic is automatically redirected to another available link.<br>
Aggregation is based on IEEE 802.3ad, Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) technology.

**This guide explains how to configure OLA in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- A [dedicated server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/bare-metal/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca)
- An Operating System / Hypervisor that supports the 802.3ad aggregation protocol (LACP)

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> OLA is configured on all network interfaces. They will form a “private aggregation”.
>
> Following the implementation of OLA, the public IP will no longer be accessible.

### Configuring OLA in the OVHcloud Control Panel

To start configuring OLA, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca){.external} and choose the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Dedicated Servers`{.action} and select your server from the list.

In the tab `Network interfaces`{.action} (1), click on the `...`{.action} button (2) to the right of "Mode" in the **OLA: OVHcloud Link Aggregation** box. Next, click `Configure private aggregation`{.action}  (2).

Make sure that both your interfaces, or interface groups, are selected and give the OLA a name. Click `Confirm`{.action} when your checks are complete.

This may take a few minutes. Once it is complete, the next step is to configure the interfaces in your operating system via a NIC link or NIC team. For the method to use, refer to the following guides for the most popular operating systems:

- [How to Configure Your NIC for OVHcloud Link Aggregation in CentOS 7](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/ola-enable-centos7).
- [How to Configure Your NIC for OVHcloud Link Aggregation in Windows Server 2019](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/ola-enable-w2k19).
- [How to Configure Your NIC for OVHcloud Link Aggregation in SLES 15](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/ola-enable-sles15).

### Restoring OLA to default values

To restore OLA to the default values, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of "Mode" in the **OLA: OVHcloud Link Aggregation** box. Then click `Unconfigure private aggregation`{.action}. Click `Confirm`{.action} in the popup menu.
