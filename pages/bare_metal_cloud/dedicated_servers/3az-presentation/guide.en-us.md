## Objective

OVHcloud offers its innovative Bare Metal service in the [3-AZ region](/links/bare-metal/regions), a significant development in the company's regionalization strategy. This service, available in the Paris metropolitan area, sets a new industry standard for reliability and performance in Bare Metal servers.

Bare Metal in the 3-AZ region caters to customers requiring high availability and redundancy in their business continuity plans. This service provides Bare Metal servers across three proximal data centers in Paris, connected by a low-latency network. It ensures enhanced security, improved performance, and uninterrupted functionality, even in the event of localized incidents.

## Overview

### Purpose of the Service

The 3-AZ region's value lies in offering three identical servers distributed across three availability zones within the same region. This setup ensures high availability and data redundancy, maintaining operational continuity and reducing the risk of data loss. The strategic distribution of servers minimizes latency and boosts application performance.

### Regionalization at OVHcloud

OVHcloud's global presence includes several regions across the world, such as Europe, the US, Canada, and APAC. The introduction of the Region concept and support of Availability Zones is a strategic initiative to provide customers with optimal performance and resilience. The Paris region is the first to adopt the 3-AZ model.

### Region Selection Tips

For optimal performance, a region should be selected closest to its users. For global availability, services should be spread across multiple regions. The 3-AZ Region is ideal for customers seeking the highest resilience and should be used to build multi-AZ application designs.

You can list your clusters here with a new tab in the interface (the servers are represented in the list underlying a cluster comprising 3 nodes):

When you select your cluster you have the list of the 3 servers inside this one:
