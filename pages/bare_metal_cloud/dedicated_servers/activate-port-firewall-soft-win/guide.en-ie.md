## Objective

To best protect your system, your Windows Server dedicated server has its own built-in firewall. By configuring it, you can increase security levels, which guarantees the availability and integrity of all elements hosted on the server, such as roles, services and shared folders.

**This guide will show you how to apply firewall rules on Windows.**

> [!primary]
>
>- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
>It is a connection-orientated protocol, i.e. with TCP, it will be possible to create connections between them in order to send data streams. This protocol ensures that data is delivered to the recipient in the same order and in the same error-free manner.
>
>- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
>This is a non-connection-orientated protocol. Its development is based on the exchange of datagrams and facilitates the sending of datagrams across the network. You will need to have established a connection to the destination beforehand.
>
>You can also select the `All local ports`{.action} checkbox to enable all TCP or UDP ports on a non-secure server. You can also select the `Specific local ports`{.action} check box to determine which port should be allowed. 
>

### Step 6: Allow or block the connection

To define the action this rule will trigger, the following options are available. Select the one that works for you.

- **Allow the connection**. This option allows full communication through this port.
- **Allow the connection if it is secure**. This option allows data to be transmitted only if the connection is authenticated via IPsec.
- **Block the connection**. This option prevents data from being routed through this port.

Select the `Allow Connection`{.action} option and click `Next`{.action}.

### Step 7: Define the firewall profile and name to apply

Finally, you must choose which profiles the rule should apply to, from public, domain or private profiles.
You can enable them all if you want.

![Step7](images/step7.PNG){.thumbnail}

Give the new rule a name and description (optional) to make it easier to use:
