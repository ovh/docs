title: Hot Swap - Software RAID
excerpt: Find out how to hot-swap a disk on a server with a software RAID configuration
updated: 2023-08-21
---

## Objective

If one of the disks on your server is failing, you can hot-swap it if you have a compatible top-range model.

**Find out the main steps for hot-swapping a disk on a server with a software RAID configuration.**

## Requirements

Hot swapping is only possible on the server ranges mHG, HG, and bHG.

To carry out the various steps of this guide, you must:

- Have a server that is mHG, HG, or bHG.
- Have a server using software RAID (with a LSI card).
- Have access to SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).
- Have the sas2ircu utility installed beforehand. (Available via the search engine [broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search/?dk=sas2ircu){.external})

In this guide, we will assume that you have received an alert for the disk /dev/sdb, Serial Number **K4GW439B**, which is defective and you want to hotswap it.

For this we will need the **Enclosure ID**, the **Slot ID**, and the **Serial Number** of the disk that needs to be replaced.

## In Linux

### Step 1&#58; Identify the disk

We have been notified that our SDB disk is defective, so we will test it and check its **Serial Number**.

<span class="output">Serial number:        K4GW439B</span> </pre></div>
We find that our SDB is actually defective (uncorrected errors in our case), and that its serial number corresponds to the alert received (via Datacentre or any other monitoring tool).

So we can move on to the next step of retrieving the **Enclosure ID** and **Slot ID** information from the disk to be replaced.

### Step 2&#58; Locate the position of the disk

In order to retrieve the **Slot ID** and **Enclosure ID** from our defective SDB disk, we will need the sas2ircu software to be installed on the server.

First, we will check that the disk is connected via a LSI card.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# lspci | grep -i LSI</span>

<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="prompt">We can see that we have a LSI card.</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="prompt">We must now determine the ID of this LSI card.</span> </pre></div><div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# ./sas2ircu list</span>

<span class="output">Copyright (c) 2009 LSI Corporation. All rights reserved.</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">         Adapter      Vendor  Device                       SubSys  SubSys</span>
<span class="output"> Index    Type          ID      ID    Pci Address          Ven ID  Dev ID</span>

<span class="output">SAS2IRCU: Utility Completed Successfully.</span> </pre></div>
The index corresponds to the ID, so our map has the index / ID 0.

With this information, we can now retrieve the **Slot ID** and **Enclosure ID** for our SDB disk, **Serial Number** K4GW439B.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# ./sas2ircu 0 display | grep -B 7 -A 2 K4GW439B</span>

<span class="output">  Serial No                               : K4GW439B</span>
<span class="output">  Protocol                                : SAS</span>
<span class="output">  Drive Type                              : SAS_HDD</span> </pre></div>
With this command we directly retrieve the information for our SDB disk.

Of course, **K4GW439B** will be replaced by the Serial Number of the drive to be replaced, and **0** by the ID of the RAID card concerned.

From our example above, the disk has the **Enclosure ID** of 1, and the **Slot ID** of 3.

### Step 3&#58; Turn on the disk indicator

With the information retrieved in the previous steps, we can turn on the LED of the defective disk for replacement with the command : ./sas2ircu 0 locate EncID:SlotID on

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# ./sas2ircu 0 locate 1:3 on</span>

<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">SAS2IRCU: LOCATE command completed successfully.</span>
<span class="output">SAS2IRCU: Command LOCATE Completed Successfully.</span>
<span class="output">SAS2IRCU: Utility Completed Successfully.</span> </pre></div>
In this example, we have used the information gathered from the previous steps where 0 is the Index of the RAID card, 1 is the Enclosure ID, and 3 is the Slot ID.

You can turn off the blinking LED of the disk by replacing "on" with "off" in the command.

Now we have to move on to the last step of removing the defective disk from the software RAID before the datacentre intervention begins.

### Step 4&#58; Remove the disk from the RAID

Before removing the defective disk from the RAID, we must set it to ``Faulty`` if this is not already the case (We are using the SDB disk in our example).

We will first look at the state of the RAID.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat</span>
<span class="output">Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath] [faulty]</span>
<span class="output">md2 : active raid1 sda2[0] sdb2[1]</span>
<span class="output">      3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]</span>
<span class="output">      bitmap: 0/29 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">md1 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]</span>
<span class="output">      20971456 blocks [2/2] [UU]</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">unused devices: <none></span> </pre></div>
We see that our defective SDB disk is part of md1 and md2 (sdb1 and sdb2).

We will now set the disk to ``Faulty`` (sdb1 in md1, and sdb2 in md2 respectively).

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --set-faulty /dev/sdb1</span>

<span class="output">mdadm: set /dev/sdb2 faulty in /dev/md2</span> </pre></div>
The RAID status is checked again.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"$ ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat</span>

<span class="output">md2 : active raid1 sda2[0] sdb2[1](/au/en/dedicated/hotswap-raid-soft/F)</span>
<span class="output">      3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [U_]</span>

<span class="output">      20971456 blocks [2/1] [U_]</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">unused devices: <none></span> </pre></div>
sdb1 and sdb2 are now showing as faulty (F).

Now we can remove the disks from the software RAID.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --remove /dev/sdb1</span>
<span class="output">mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb1 from /dev/md1</span> </pre></div><div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --remove /dev/sdb2</span>
<span class="output">mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb2 from /dev/md2</span> </pre></div>
Then we check one last time that the disk is no longer present.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat</span>
<span class="output">Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath] [faulty]</span>
<span class="output">md2 : active raid1 sda2[0]</span>
<span class="output">      3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [U_]</span>
<span class="output">      bitmap: 0/29 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">md1 : active raid1 sda1[0]</span>
<span class="output">      20971456 blocks [2/1] [U_]</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">unused devices: <none></span> </pre></div>
We are now ready to have the defective disk replaced by a datacentre technician.

As we have prepared the server for the intervention, the new disk will take the SDB name, and all that is left to do is to rebuild the software RAID.

## In Windows

The Windows-based guide will be similar to the replacement guide for Linux. We will use the same utility: sas2ircu, and the commands in Windows are the same as it is in Linux.

- an mHG, HG or BHG server
- a software RAID (with an LSI card)
- SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) access
- the "sas2ircu" utility (use the [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search/?dk=sas2ircu){.external} search engine to find it).

## Instructions

### On Linux

#### Step 1: Identify the disk concerned

To illustrate the purpose of this guide, we assume that we have received an alert for the`/dev/sdb` disk. The disk is defective, and we want to hot-swap it. **Please adapt the details of this guide according to your specific situation.**

To begin, test and check the **Serial Number** of the disk concerned.

>>> Long (extended) Self Test duration: 34237 seconds [570.6 minutes]
```

Here, you will note that:

- the "**SDB**" disk has failed due to uncorrected errors
- its **Serial Number** corresponds to the alert received (via the datacentre or any other monitoring tool)

To get only the **Serial Number**:

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# smartctl -a /dev/sdb | grep Serial
>>> Serial number:        K4GW439B
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve the disk’s position

You must now find the **Slot ID** and the **Enclosure ID** of the disk concerned. To do this, use the «sas2ircu» tool already installed on the server.

Then start by checking that the disks are properly connected via an LSI card.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# lspci | grep -i LSI
>>> 81:00.0 Serial Attached SCSI controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS2004 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-2 [Spitfire] (rev 03)
```

If this is the case, determine the ID of this LSI card.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# ./sas2ircu list
>>> LSI Corporation SAS2 IR Configuration Utility.
>>> Version 5.00.00.00 (2010.02.09)
>>> Copyright (c) 2009 LSI Corporation. All rights reserved.

>>>          Adapter      Vendor  Device                       SubSys  SubSys
>>>  Index    Type          ID      ID    Pci Address          Ven ID  Dev ID
>>>  -----  ------------  ------  ------  -----------------    ------  ------
>>>      0     SAS2004     1000h    70h   00h:81h:00h:00h      1000h   3010h
>>> SAS2IRCU: Utility Completed Successfully.
```

The index corresponds to the ID. Here, the card has the index/ID 0.

With this information, now retrieve for the disk concerned (via its **Serial Number**): the **Slot ID** and the **Enclosure ID**.

```sh

```

This command is used to obtain the disk information, including the **Serial Number**, which is the K4GW439B here.

In our example, we retrieved the **Enclosure ID** (corresponding to 1) and the **Slot ID** (corresponding to 3).

#### Stage 3: Switch on the disk

Using the information retrieved during the previous steps, turn on the LED of the faulty disk, and replace it with the command `./sas2ircu 0 locate EncID:SlotID on`. Customise it to suit your situation, as per the example below:

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# ./sas2ircu 0 locate 1:3 on
>>> LSI Corporation SAS2 IR Configuration Utility.
>>> Version 5.00.00.00 (2010.02.09)
>>> Copyright (c) 2009 LSI Corporation. All rights reserved.

>>> SAS2IRCU: LOCATE Command completed successfully.
>>> SAS2IRCU: Command LOCATE Completed Successfully.
>>> SAS2IRCU: Utility Completed Successfully.
```

You can disable the disk flashing, by replacing "on" with "off" in the command.

#### Step 4: Remove the defective disk from the RAID

If you have not already done so, switch the defective disk to **Faulty**. Then look at the RAID status.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat
>>> Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath] [faulty]
>>> md2 : active raid1 sda2[0] sdb2[1]
>>>       3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
>>>       bitmap: 0/29 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk

>>> md1 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
>>>       20971456 blocks [2/2] [UU]

>>> unused devices: <none>
```

In this example, the defective disk is part of md1 and md2 (sdb1 and sdb2). We will therefore change this one to **Faulty**, respectively sdb1 in md1 and sdb2 in md2.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --set-faulty /dev/sdb1
>>> mdadm: set /dev/sdb1 faulty in /dev/md1
```

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --set-faulty /dev/sdb2
>>> mdadm: set /dev/sdb2 faulty in /dev/md2
```

once you have made these changes, check the RAID status again.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat
>>> Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath] [faulty]
>>> md2 : active raid1 sda2[0] sdb2[1](F)
>>>       3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [U_]
>>>       bitmap: 0/29 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk

>>> md1 : active raid1 sdb1[2](F) sda1[0]
>>>       20971456 blocks [2/1] [U_]

>>> unused devices: <none>
```

The sdb1 and sdb2 have been switched to faulty **(F)**. You can now remove the disk from the RAID.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --remove /dev/sdb1
>>> mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb1 from /dev/md1
```

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --remove /dev/sdb2
>>> mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb2 from /dev/md2
```

Finally, check that the disk is no longer present.

```sh
root@ns3054662:/home# cat /proc/mdstat
>>> Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath] [faulty]
>>> md2 : active raid1 sda2[0]
>>>       3885385728 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [U_]
>>>       bitmap: 0/29 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk

>>> md1 : active raid1 sda1[0]
>>>       20971456 blocks [2/1] [U_]

>>> unused devices: <none>
```

The defective disk is now ready to be replaced by a datacentre technician. Once the operation is complete, you just have to resync the RAID. To do this, you can use the following guide: [Configuring software RAID](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/raid_soft){.external}

### On Windows

#### Step 1: Identify the disk

To illustrate the purpose of this guide, we assume that we have received an alert for the`/dev/sdb` disk. The disk is defective, and we want to hot-swap it. **Please adapt the details of this guide according to your specific situation.**

> [!primary]
>
> It is important to launch the command terminal as an administrator, so that you do not receive any errors.
>

To begin, test and check the **Serial Number** of the disk concerned. In the screenshot below, the storage is not really defective, but we will act as if it were.

![smart_sdb_windows](images/smart_sdb_windows.png){.thumbnail}

Here, you will note that:

- the "**SDB**" disk has failed due to uncorrected errors
- its **Serial Number** corresponds to the alert received (via the datacentre or any other monitoring tool)

#### Step 2: Retrieve the disk’s position

You will now need to find the **Slot ID** and the **Enclosure ID** of the disk concerned. To do this, use the «sas2ircu» tool already installed on the server.

Start by determining the ID of this LSI card.

![id_lsi_windows](images/id_lsi_windows.png){.thumbnail}

Our LSI card has the index/ID “0”.

With this information, now retrieve for the disk concerned (via its **Serial Number**): the **Slot ID** and the **Enclosure ID**.

![select-string](images/select-string.png){.thumbnail}

You can use this command to retrieve the disk information, including the **Serial Number**, which is K4G187WB here.

In our example, we have retrieved the **Enclosure ID** (corresponding to 1) and the **Slot ID** (corresponding to 1).

#### Stage 3: Switch on the disk

Using the information retrieved during the previous steps, turn on the LED of the faulty disk, and replace it with the command `.\sas2ircu 0 locate EncID:SlotID on`. Customise it to suit your situation, as per the example below:

![locate](images/locate.png){.thumbnail}

You can disable the disk flashing, by replacing "on" with "off" in the command.

#### Step 4: Remove the defective disk from the RAID

You can do this from the **Disk Management** interface of your Windows server.

The defective disk is now ready to be replaced by a datacentre technician. Once the operation is complete, you just have to resync the RAID. To do this, you can use the following guide: [Configuring software RAID](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/raid_soft){.external}
