## Objective

Enabling Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) on your server allows you to run SGX-ready applications. Intel SGX delivers advanced hardware and RAM security encryption features, in order to isolate parts of code and data that are specific to each application.

**This guide explains how to enable the SGX feature, in the OVHcloud Control Panel or via the OVHcloud API.**

## Requirements

- A dedicated server compatible with the [SGX option](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/bare-metal/intel-software-guard-extensions/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg) or the [OVHcloud API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/)
- Login credentials received via email after the installation
- Ubuntu 18.04 or equivalent installed on the server

## Instructions

### From the OVHcloud Control Panel

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg), go to the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section and then select the server on which you wish to enable SGX from **Dedicated Servers** in the left-hand sidebar.

#### Enabling the option

Scroll down to the "Advanced features" box and click on `...`{.action} next to "Security - Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)". Select `Enable SGX`{.action} from the drop-down menu.

On the following screen, click the `Enable`{.action} button.

You can either choose to enable SGX with a specific amount of reserved memory or enable it by allowing your software to automatically reserve the memory it needs. Once you have made your choice, click `Confirm`{.action}.

A confirmation pop-up will appear. Please confirm you have understood that activating Intel SGX technology will make your server reboot.

> [!warning]
>
> This will cause your server to reboot once or several times, depending on your server model.

#### Disabling the option

Scroll down to the "Advanced features" box and click on `...`{.action} next to "Security - Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)". Select `Modify SGX`{.action} from the drop-down menu. Choose the `Disable`{.action} option and then click `Confirm`{.action}.

> This will cause your server to reboot once or several times, depending on your server model.

Continue with [Step 3](#sgx-softwares) of the instructions below.

### Using the OVHcloud API

#### Step 1: Logging in to the API console

On the [OVHcloud API page](https://ca.api.ovh.com/) click on `Login`{.action} in the top-right corner. On the following page, enter the credentials of your OVHcloud account.

#### Step 2: Enabling SGX

Retrieve the name of your server from the list returned from this call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server GET /dedicated/server

Verify that your service has the SGX option, by calling: 

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server GET /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx

![SGX disabled](images/get-disabled.png){.thumbnail}

Enable SGX using the server name:

> [!warning]
>
> This will cause your server to reboot once or several times, depending on your server model.

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server POST /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx/configure

![Configure SGX](images/post-configure.png){.thumbnail}

Check the progress of the configuration task by calling this endpoint with the *taskId* returned by the previous call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server GET /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/task/{taskId}

![Get SGX configuration task](images/get-task.png){.thumbnail}

You can verify that the status is set to enabled:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server GET /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx

![SGX enabled](images/get-enabled.png){.thumbnail}

### Step 3: Installing the SGX software stack <a name="sgx-softwares"></a>

Use the following commands to install Intel's driver and SDK to be able to develop and run SGX applications.  

First, install some dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential ocaml ocamlbuild automake autoconf libtool wget python libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev debhelper cmake git
```

Then, download, build and install the SGX software stack:

```bash
BASE_DIR=/opt/intel
[[ -d $BASE_DIR ]] || sudo mkdir -p $BASE_DIR && sudo chown `whoami` $BASE_DIR
cd $BASE_DIR

git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git

cd linux-sgx
git checkout sgx_2.6
./download_prebuilt.sh
make -j 6
make sdk_install_pkg -j 6
make deb_pkg -j 6
$BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.6.100.51363.bin --prefix=$BASE_DIR/

sudo dpkg -i $BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/deb/libsgx-urts_2.6.100.51363-bionic1_amd64.deb $BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/deb/libsgx-enclave-common_2.6.100.51363-bionic1_amd64.deb
```

Download and install the driver:

```bash
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/linux-2.6/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
```

### Step 4: Rebooting to finish the installation

The server needs to reboot before continuing.

### Step 5: Validating the installation (optional)

You can use a sample application to validate the installation. Build one of the sample apps provided:

```bash
BASE_DIR=/opt/intel
cd $BASE_DIR/sgxsdk/SampleCode/LocalAttestation/
source $BASE_DIR/sgxsdk/environment
make SGX_DEBUG=0 SGX_MODE=HW SGX_PRERELEASE=1
```

Run the app:

```bash
ovh@nsXXXX:/opt/intel/sgxsdk/SampleCode/LocalAttestation$ ./app
