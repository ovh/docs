## VMware ESXi End of Support

Due to Broadcomâ€™s acquisition of VMware, Broadcom has decided to end the general availability of its Free vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi). Since June 6, 2024, all ESXi images have been removed from our catalog of operating system models for our Bare Metal Dedicated Servers. However, this change will not affect your servers currently using ESXi images. However, you will not be able to reinstall your current server or install a new server using any of the ESXi templates previously provided by OVHcloud.

Although it may be technically feasible to install ESXi on our dedicated servers, we cannot assist or support the configuration or operation of VMware ESXi. We recommend using one of the hypervisors we officially support to ensure the best possible user experience.

If you are looking for a hypervisor to use with our dedicated servers, we recommend using one of the following:

- Proxmox VE
- Microsoft Hyper-V

We also recommend considering [OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud solutions](/links/hosted-private-cloud/hosted-private-cloud).
