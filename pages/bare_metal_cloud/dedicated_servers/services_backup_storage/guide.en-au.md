#### Accessing the backup storage from an IP address outside of your account <a name="accessbackup"></a>

Access to the storage space of your dedicated server is restricted to IP addresses linked to your OVHcloud customer acccount.

In order to add other IP addresses from which to access, you can use the [OVHcloud API](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps). This will allow you to retrieve your backup data from a different service.

> [!warning]
> Only OVHcloud IP addresses can be authorised.
>

Log in to [api.ovh.com](https://ca.api.ovh.com/) and use the following call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server POST /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/features/backupFTP/access
>

Fill in the fields as follows:

- `serviceName`: The service name of your server
- `cifs`: check if necessary
- `ftp`: check if necessary
- `ipBlock`: enter the IP address that will have access in the form `1.2.3.4/32`
- `nfs`: check if necessary

> [!primary]
>
> The backup storage service does not automatically back up your data, it only provides the space and the access protocols. It is your responsibility to implement an adequate backup strategy using the tools of your choice.
>

> [!warning]
> 
> The backup storage service has a limit of three simultaneous connections on an IP.

#### FTP/FTPS

##### ncftp (for Linux)

To save individual files to your backup storage, you can use the following command:

```sh
ncftpput -u FtpUserName -p FtpPassword HostName /FolderLocation /File
```

**Please note that this command does not support the FTPS protocol. If you need secure transfer you should use lftp or curl instead.**

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FtpUsername** : Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **FolderLocation**: The path to the target folder where you want to save the file
* **File**: The name of the file you want to save

Backing up a folder is done by creating a folder archive, and then uploading it all with one command:

```sh
tar czf - /FolderName | ncftpput -u FtpUserName -p FtpPassword -c HostName ArchiveName.tar.gz
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FolderName**: The path to the folder you want to back up
* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **ArchiveName**: The name of the folder you want to back up

To download an archive file from your backup storage, you can use the following command:

```sh
ncftpget -v -u FtpUsername -p FtpPassword HostName /LocalFolder /File
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **LocalFolder**: The path to the local folder where you want to save the file
* **File**: The path to the file you want to download

##### Curl (for Linux)

> [!primary]
>
> To use FTPS you must change the hostname of the backup storage. For example, if the name of your backup storage is ftpback-rbxX-YYY.ip-Z.Z.Z.Z.net, you need to change it to ftpback-rbxX-YYY.mybackup.ovh.net. You also need to add the -ssl flag to the commands below.
>

To save individual files to your backup storage, you can use the following command:

```sh
curl -aT File ftp://FtpUsername:FtpPassword@HostName/FolderLocation
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **File**: The name of the file you want to save
* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **FolderLocation**: The path to the target folder where you want to save the file

Backing up a folder is done by creating a folder archive, and then uploading it all with one command:

```sh
tar czf - /FolderName | curl ftp://FtpUsername:FtpPassword@HostName/FolderLocation/ArchiveName-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).tar.gz -T -
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FolderName**: The path to the folder you want to back up

cd /LocalFolder
curl -u FtpUsername:FtpPassword ftp://HostName/File 
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **LocalFolder**: The name of the local folder where you want to save the file
* **File**: The path to the file you want to download

#### lftp (for Linux)

> [!primary]
>
> lftp uses FTP+SSL/TLS by default. So you must change the host name of the backup storage. For example, if the name of your backup storage is ftpback-rbxX-YYY.ip-Z.Z.Z.Z.net, you need to change it to ftpback-rbxX-YYY.mybackup.ovh.net.
>

To save individual files to your backup storage, you can use the following command:

```sh
lftp ftp://FtpUsername:FtpPassword@HostName:21 -e "cd FolderLocation; put File; quit"
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **File**: The name of the file you want to save
* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **FolderLocation**: The path to the target folder where you want to save the file

Backing up a folder is done by creating a folder archive, and then uploading it all with one command:

```sh
tar czf - /FolderName | ftp://FtpUsername:FtpPassword@HostName:21 -e "cd FolderLocation; put /dev/stdin -o ArchiveName-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).tar.gz;quit"
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FolderName**: The path to the folder you want to back up
* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **FolderLocation**: The path to the target folder where you want to save the folder
* **ArchiveName**: The name of the folder you want to back up

To download an archive file from your backup storage, you can use the following commands:

```sh
cd /LocalFolder
lftp ftp://FtpUsername:FtpPassword@HostName:21 -e "get /File; quit"
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **FtpUsername**: Your FTP username
* **FtpPassword**: Your FTP password
* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **LocalFolder**: The name of the local folder where you want to save the file
* **File**: The path to the file you want to download

##### Filezilla (for Windows)

After installing FileZilla on your server, you can configure it to connect to your backup storage using the FTP credentials that were emailed to you when you activated the Backup storage. To connect successfully, you will need the host name and password of your Backup storage.

#### NFS

First make sure that you have authorised your IP blocks to access the storage and use the NFS protocol. Depending on your Linux operating system, you might have to install the **NFS** client and start the NFS/portmap service.

Once you have the NFS client installed and portmap running, you can mount the NFS share like a normal partition as shown below:

```sh
mount -t nfs HostName:/export/ftpbackup/ServiceName /FolderMount
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **ServiceName**: The name of your server (e.g. ns0000000.ip-123-123-123.net)
* **FolderMount**: The folder where you want to mount the NFS share

Once the share is mounted, you can use commands like **cp** and rsync like on a normal directory.

#### CIFS

##### Windows

Log on to your server, open the command prompt, and type the following command:

```sh
net use z: \\HostName\ServiceName
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **ServiceName**: The name of your server (e.g. ns0000000.ip-123-123-123.net)

You might receive the following error message:

```console
System error 1272 has occurred.

You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
```

This error should be resolvable by modifying the Windows Registry: Open the Windows utility *regedit* and locate the entry `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters`. Set the value of `AllowInsecureGuestAuth` to "1". You can find more information on this issue on the [Microsoft support pages](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/you-cant-access-this-shared-folder-because-your/01d15775-2cbe-41f8-beb8-84ce588b34ab).

##### Linux

Establish an SSH connection to your server, and type the following command:

```sh
mount -t cifs -o sec=ntlm,uid=root,gid=100,dir_mode=0700,username=root,password= //HostName/ServiceName /mnt/FolderMount
```

The code example above contains variables, which you will need to substitute with your own values.

* **HostName**: The host name of your backup storage
* **ServiceName**: The name of your server (e.g. ns0000000.ip-123-123-123.net)
* **FolderMount**: The folder where you want to mount the share (it must already exist)
