## Objective

The OVHcloud Managed Bare Metal Control Panel enables you to easily manage the numerous settings of your Managed Bare Metal infrastructure.

**This guide explains the management options available in your Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- a [Managed Bare Metal infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/managed-bare-metal/)
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

### General information tab

Once you have navigated to the "Bare Metal Cloud" section of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), and selected your service under `Managed Bare Metal`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar, you will have access to a general overview of your Managed Bare Metal service:

![General information](images/controlpanel1-e.png){.thumbnail}

At the top of the page, (1 on the image), you will find the name and description of your Managed Bare Metal. Feel free to customise it â€“ this will be very useful if you have several infrastructures. 

On the left (2 on the image), all your infrastructures and the data centres of which they consist are listed.

#### General information

On the main page, in the left-hand section, you will find the general information of your Managed Bare Metal.

![General information](images/controlpanel2-e.png){.thumbnail}

- The "Description" of your infrastructure (label it here according to your needs)
- The version number of the software
- The data centre, and more precisely, the zone in which your infrastructure is located
- The access policy of your infrastructure (`Open` or `Restricted`) 
- The number of virtual data centres in your infrastructure
- The number of IP address blocks (with the option to order IP blocks)
- Links to your management interfaces

#### Options and compliance

The middle section provides an overview of the status of activation regarding the Managed Bare Metal options.

Please refer to the [data centre view section](./#data-centre-view) below for more information.

> 

### Users tab

All users who can log in to vSphere are listed in this section:

![Users](images/controlpanel6-e.png){.thumbnail}

You can create a user by clicking on the `Create User`{.action} button.

For each user, their general information and the rights granted to them are specified in the table:

- the user ID
- the first name (optional)
- the last name (optional)
- the email address (optional)
- the phone number (optional)
- the right *token validator*, which allows to validate sensitive operations
- the right *IP*, which allows access with the OVHcloud Network plugin
- the right *Additional IP*, which allows to manage Additional IPs on the Managed Bare Metal
- the *Diagnosis* status, informing you whether this user is actually enabled

You have several options when you click on the `...`{.action} button next to a user:

- editing the entries in this table (changing the rights listed above, adding an email address, adding a phone number)
- viewing and modifying this user's rights per data centre
- changing this user's password
- deleting this user

Following are detailed listings of the available user rights by data centre.

![User rights per data centre](images/controlpanel7-e.png){.thumbnail}

- **vSphere access**: to set the global rights for a user in vSphere

|Right|Description|
|---|---|
|Provider|reserved for OVHcloud administrators|
|None|no access|
|Read-only|read access only|
|Read/Write|read and write access|

- **Access to the VM Network**: concerns management rights over the public network section (a.k.a "VM Network" in the vSphere interface)

|Right|Description|
|---|---|
|Provider|allows VMs to be configured on a public network|
|None|no access|
|Read-only|read access only|

- **Add resources**: gives the right to add additional resources through the OVHcloud plugin in the vSphere client

### Security tab

The vCenter access policy can be managed in this tab.

![Security settings](images/controlpanel8-e.png){.thumbnail}

You can configure security settings with the buttons on the right:

- Set the timeout for a login session.
- Specify the number of concurrent connections allowed.
- Change the access policy to "Restricted" or "Open", with permission by source IP. IP addresses are being managed in the table in this tab (`...`{.action} button).

> [!warning]
>
>  If you set the access policy to "Restricted" and do not enter any IP addresses, no user will be able to connect to the vSphere client. However, virtual machines will remain accessible.
> 

- The disconnection policy decides whether to disconnect the first or last logged-in user if the limit is reached. For example, if 50 users are logged in, and a 51st user logs in, the first (or last) user to log in will be disconnected.

The second table at the bottom of the page concerns the management of Virtual Machine Encryption Key Management Servers.

You can find more details about this option in [this guide](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/managed_bare_metal/vm_encrypt).

### Operations tab

This tab shows the history of tasks executed on your Managed Bare Metal service.

![Operations](images/controlpanel9-e.png){.thumbnail}

The list provides details on each task, so you can verify if an operation is in error, if a scheduled maintenance is ongoing, and more. You can change the date of a maintenance by clicking on `...`{.action}.

> [!primary]
>
> If your access to the vSphere client is denied, a scheduled maintenance may be in progress. Check this tab first before taking further measures.

### Windows Licence tab

This tab allows you to activate Windows SPLA licences for your data centre by clicking on the button.

You can customise the name of your data centre by clicking on the pencil icon. Below, you can add a description.

You can also order a new host from here by clicking on the button on the left.

#### Datastores tab

The tab for your datastores looks similar to the previous one.
