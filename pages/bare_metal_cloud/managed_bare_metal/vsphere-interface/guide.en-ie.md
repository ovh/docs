## Objective

**This guide explains the different ways to connect to the vSphere client.**

## Requirements

- a [Managed Bare Metal infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/managed-bare-metal/) of which you are an administrative contact (to receive login credentials)
- a user account with access to vSphere (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))

## Instructions

### Retrieving credentials

Login credentials are sent out by email when the Managed Bare Metal service is created, when a password is changed or when a user profile is created.

```
Name/IP address: pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com Username: admin password: xxxxxx
```

To ensure access, please refer to the VMware documentation, in which the different ports to be opened in your firewall are listed: [Client access](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/1012382){.external}.

### Using the HTML5 web client

The HTML5 web client is available on the Managed Bare Metal web interface at this URL: `https://pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com/ui` (replace pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com with your Managed Bare Metal address).
