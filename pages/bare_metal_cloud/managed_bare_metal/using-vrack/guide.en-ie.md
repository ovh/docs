## Objective

The OVHcloud vRack feature makes it possible to connect different cloud services with each other, within one or more secure private networks (VLANs).

**This guide explains how to set this up with a Managed Bare Metal infrastructure.**

## Instructions

### OVHcloud Control Panel

After your [Managed Bare Metal infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/managed-bare-metal/) is delivered, it will be displayed in the section `vRack` (under "Bare Metal Cloud" in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)) and the "datacenter" will be automatically included into a vRack.

You can move the "datacenter" of your Managed Bare Metal infrastructure to another vRack by selecting it and clicking on the `Move`{.action} button.

### vSphere client

In the vSphere client, you can find vRack-capable VLANs in the `Networks` section, located in the *vrack* folder.

> [!success]
>
> By default, OVHcloud delivers an infrastructure with 11 VLANs included (VLAN10 to VLAN20).
>

You can change their settings or create them again by following [this guide](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/managed_bare_metal/vlan-creation).

You can then assign these *Distributed Port Groups* to the network interfaces of your virtual machines.
