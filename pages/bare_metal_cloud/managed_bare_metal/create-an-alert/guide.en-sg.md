## Objective

You can create an alert on all items in your Managed Bare Metal: the datacentre itself, the clusters, the VMs, the datastores, the network ...

**This guide explains how to create alerts on your vSphere client.**

## Requirements

- a [Managed Bare Metal infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/managed-bare-metal/)
- a user account with access to [vSphere](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/managed_bare_metal/vsphere-interface) (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))

## Instructions

### Creating an alert

To create an alert, right-click on the datacentre or any other item you want to monitor, and then click on `Alarms`{.action} and `New Alarm Definition`{.action}.

### Setting name and target

The first step is to name the alert and set its target. You can also add a description.

### Setting alert rules

The second step is to define the rules of the alert and the actions it triggers.

The `IF` field allows you to set an alert trigger from a selection of variables. Depending on the variable chosen, a list of arguments will be offered.

The `THEN` field allows you to indicate that the alert is triggered with a certain degree of criticality and will result in actions such as sending an email, executing a script or shutting down a VM.

This allows you to monitor the RAM of a host, for example, by specifying a threshold not to exceed before its status goes on alert and you receive a warning email.

> You can add several rules to your alert by clicking `ADD ANOTHER RULE`{.action}.

### Suspending an alert

The third step allows you to set the end of the alert criteria and trigger new actions.

### Alert summary

The last step shows you a summary of the rules defined. You can activate the alarm by checking the cursor or choose to activate it later by right-clicking the selected item and then clicking `Alarms`{.action} and `Enable Alarm Actions`{.action}.
