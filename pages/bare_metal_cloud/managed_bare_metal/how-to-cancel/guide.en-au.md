Please be aware that this action will remove any data on the infrastructure as soon as the termination is confirmed. No pro rata refund will be made if the infrastructure is terminated before the end of the month.

### Step 2: Confirm termination

You can also find this email in your OVHcloud Control Panel. Click on your name at the top right and then on `Service emails`{.action}.

The subject of the email is:

> **Deleting your Managed Bare Metal "pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx"**.

The email contains a clickable link that will allow you to confirm the termination of your offer.

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that this link is valid for **72 hours**. We therefore advise you to make your request for termination from the 218th of the month.
>

You can also validate the termination request through the following OVHcloud API:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud POST /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/confirmTermination
>

You will then need to fill in the validation token available in the termination confirmation email.
