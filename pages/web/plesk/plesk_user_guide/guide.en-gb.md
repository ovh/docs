It is possible to add Failover IPv4 addresses on your Plesk hosting. This can be useful if you want to associate an IP address per website, or take advantage of a geolocalized IP address.
You can find all information about Failover IP addresses on [this page.](https://www.ovh.com/fr/serveurs_dedies/ip_failover.xml){.external}
Only Failover IP addresses can be routed to Plesk web hosting, not RIPE blocks.

### Questions/Answers

> [!faq]
>
> Do I have root access to my Plesk Web Hosting server ?
>> 
>> As an "as-a-service" offer, you do not have access to the server's root account. This superuser access is only available to OVH administrators.
>> However, you can also access your Plesk Web Hosting server through SSH by creating a user from your Plesk panel. To do this, in your Plesk panel, use the "Access to web hosting" menu of the concerned domain, then choose a shell type for the domain owner. In order to avoid limitations of access to the server's binaries, we have opened access to non-chrooted shells.
>> If you have actions to assign that require root privileges, please [contact us](#contact_us){.external}, we will study the feasibility of your request.
> What are the limitations of the Reseller account against an Administrator account ?
>> 
>> Your master account of the Plesk panel is a unique reseller account. This is not an administrator account, so some restrictions may apply.
>> The following is a non-exhaustive list of these restrictions :
>> 
>> *Rights available :*
>> - Access to customer management, domains, subscriptions and service packs
>> - Access to tools and user configurations (backup, interface, traffic, resources, etc.)
>> - Access to Service Provider and Power User Views
>> - Access to the Plesk application catalog
>>
>> *Restricted Rights :*
>> - No access to reseller management (access only to your reseller account settings)
>> - No access to tools and global configurations of the server (management of services and daemons, updates, etc.)
>> - No access to the Plesk extensions catalog (do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact_us){.external} if you need an extension, we will study the feasibility of your request)
>>
>> If you want to test Plesk Web Hosting from OVH in real-world conditions, you can use [our demo.](#plesk_demo){.external}
> I don't need a reseller option on my Plesk Web Hosting. Is it mandatory ?
>> 
>> The reseller option is included by default in the license of this offer. If you do not need it, you can use your Plesk in Power User view instaed of Service Provider view. This will hide all Reseller related menus.
> How to change PHP values ?
>> 
>> You can modify PHP settings related to your hosting directly from the Plesk panel.
>> You will find information about [this setting in the Plesk guides.](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/onyx/administrator-guide/website-management/websites-and-domains/hosting-settings/web-scripting-settings/php-settings.70742/){.external}
>> 
>> If a value you want to change is not available in the Plesk panel, you can place a *.user.ini* file at the root of the directory that should apply this value.
>> Here is the [list of PHP directives](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php){.external}, the [configuration modes](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php){.external} and how to [use the .user.ini for PHP-FPM.](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php){.external}
> The emails of my website are not sent
>> 
>> If you have created a new site and activated the email service for this domain, the emails will then be delivered locally and not returned to the email server specified in the domain MX fields.
>> If the mailboxes associated with the domain **are not** hosted on your Plesk hosting, disable the email service of this domain in your Plesk panel.
>> If your emails are still not sent, test with a simple PHP script by sending to an external mailbox (OVH MX / Exchange, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) to validate the email server.
> What ports are opened on my server ?
>> 
>> As an "as-a-service" offer, the firewall of your Plesk hosting server is managed by the OVH administrators.
>> We are working on adding an option on this offer to let you add or remove your own firewall rules. Do not hesitate to contact our [mailing list](#contact_us){.external} in order to monitor the progress of the roadmap.
>> Do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact_us){.external} if you wish to open specific ports.
>> 
>> Here are the ports opened by default :
>> *Inbound* : 20, 21, 22, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143, 443, 465, 587, 993, 995, 8443, 8447
>> *Outbound* : 20, 21, 25, 43, 53, 80, 123, 443, 5224, 11371
> Can I access my MySQL / PostgreSQL server from outside ?
>> 
>> Even if the Plesk panel allows you to define MySQL / PostgreSQL user rights from external networks, the MySQL and PostgreSQL ports are closed by the firewall.
