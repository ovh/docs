To delete an account within your Email Pro service, you will need to cancel it by changing its renewal configuration to **None**. To do this, go to the step ["Modifying the renewal frequency for your accounts"](#periodicity).

Go to the `Email accounts`{.action} tab of your service, then click on the `...`{.action} button next to the account concerned. Next, click `Reset this account`{.action}. Once you have reset the account, it will remain empty until its expiry date.
