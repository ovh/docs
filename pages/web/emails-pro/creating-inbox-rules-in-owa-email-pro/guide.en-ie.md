## Introduction

With Email Pro, you can send and receive your emails using a device and client of your choice. To access an account from anywhere via web browser, OVHcloud provides an online email client called Outlook Web Application (OWA). Our [webmail login page](https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail) is the single point of access to the respective OWA for all active email accounts on MX Plan (included in your [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/web-hosting/)), [Email Pro](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/email-pro/) and [Hosted Exchange](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/hosted-exchange/).

Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/creating-inbox-rules-in-owa) to learn about creating inbox rules.
