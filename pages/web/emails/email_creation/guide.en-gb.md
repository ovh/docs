## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

Depending on the date your service was activated and whether [it was recently migrated](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/mxplan-migration/){.external}, you are using either the legacy version or the new version of the MX Plan solution. Before you proceed with this guide, you need to check which version you are using. 

To do this, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, and open the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Emails`{.action}, then choose the name of the MX Plan service concerned. Continue with the next steps, depending on which version you own.

- **Name**: Enter a surname.
- **Name to display**: Enter the name you want to be displayed as a sender when you send emails from this address.

Once you have filled in all of the required fields, click `Next`{.action}.
