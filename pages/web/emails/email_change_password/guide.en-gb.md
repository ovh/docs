## Objective

The email addresses in your MX Plan allow you to send and receive your email through your preferred device. Access is granted via the password associated with your email address.

**Find out how to change the password for an email address created in your MX Plan account.**

## Requirements
- You need to have an MX Plan email address (included in [OVH Web Hosting plans](https://www.ovh.co.uk/web-hosting/){.external} or available separately).
- You must have permission to manage the MX Plan in question from your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Log in to your email interface

To begin the procedure, log in to your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}. Click on `Emails`{.action} in the service menu on the left, then select the domain name for which you have taken out an MX Plan package. Next, go to the `Emails`{.action} tab.

The table shown contains all the email addresses created as part of your MX Plan package.

> For security reasons, please follow the required conditions when you choose a new password. We also recommend:
>
> - Not using the same password twice.
>
> - Setting a password that does not contain any personal information (don’t include your surname, first name, or date of birth, for example).
>
> - Renewing your password regularly.
>
> - Not keeping any written records of your password, and not sending passwords to other people using your email address.
>
> - Not saving your passwords in your browser, even if your browser offers to do so.

### Step 3: Access your email address

Once you have changed your password, you can access your email address. There are two ways you can do this:

- **By using our online application, Roundcube**: Go to <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>, then enter your email address and the new password. If you have just modified your password and the authentication fails, wait a few moments, then try to sign in again.

- **By using compatible email software**: You will need to enter the new password on all the devices on which your email address has been set up. A window may pop up automatically, asking you to do this. If it does not, please contact your email software's publisher to find out how to enter the new password, as this procedure is different for every software package.
