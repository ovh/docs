## Overview
EV SSL certificates offered by OVH are published by the certificate authority Comodo. Comodo establishes the legitimacy of your company.

### Why choose an EV SSL certificate?
EV SSL certificates guarantee that a website is really managed by the website publisher and that it exists legally. When you visit a website secured by an EV SSL certificate, the EV SSL certificate displays the name of the company in question near the famous green lock.
