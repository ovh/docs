## Objective

With [Start10M](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/free-web-hosting/){.external}, OVHcloud offers you a 10 MB web hosting plan, and an email account with 5 GB of storage. This guide will show you how to activate a Start 10M hosting on your [domain name](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/){.external}.

> [!warning]
>
> This 10 MB free hosting plan is suitable for a simple webpage presentation, it **does not include a database**.
> It is also suitable if you do not need several `MX plan` email addresses. 
> If you would like to set up a website with several pages and require a database, such as a CMS (WordPress, Joomla!, PrestaShop, Drupal, etc.), please order one of [our web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/) directly from our website or your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}.

> [!warning]
>
> If you tick one or both of the `DNS A record` and `DNS MX record` boxes, this will overwrite the configuration originally set up in your domain's DNS zone.
>
> If your DNS zone is not managed in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, you will need to make the modifications manually in your external DNS zone.

> If your project will quickly evolve to a hosting plan with a database, larger storage space or more email addresses, you can switch directly and only from Start 10M to a **Personal** hosting plan from your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}.

> To switch to the **Pro** or **Performance** plan, you will need to switch from the Start 10M plan to the Personal** plan beforehand.
>
> You can also choose to delete the free offer by taking care to retrieve your hosting data and the content of your email address beforehand.
