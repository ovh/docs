Enable ModSecurity in one click from your control panel to get enhanced protection.

With the Core Rule Set (CRS), your ModSecurity is preconfigured in an optimal way straight away, protecting you against the most common attacks: 



- Trojan
- Email injections
- Broken PDF files
- File injections on your hosting system
- SQL or XSS type injections
- etc.
