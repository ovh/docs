## Step 1: Setup
To create your email signature, log in to your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login.html). 

Under "Exchange", select your Exchange platform.

Select "Advanced Mode" in the top right-hand corner. 

Click on the "Signature" tab and then "Add a signature".

## Step 2: Setup
Use the available tools to customise and format your signature.

You can also customise the generic signature with each user's contact details using variables.

To insert an image or logo, click the "image" button and enter the image or logo's URL.

To do this more quickly, you can also drag and drop the image or logo from your browser to the signature tool.

You can activate the signature only for outgoing emails (to an email address not linked to your domain) by ticking the relevant box.

Click "Confirm" to save your signature.

It will be added to all the emails sent from the domain name you've chosen.
