## Objective

Every OVHcloud email account has a dedicated storage space. By managing your storage space properly, you can avoid it becoming saturated, also known as “overquota”. By default, the emails you receive and send are stored on the server of your email account. You can also store your emails locally on your computer using an email client (Outlook, MacOS Mail, Thunderbird, etc.).
