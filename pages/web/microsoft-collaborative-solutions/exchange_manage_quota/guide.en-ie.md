## Objective

Every OVHcloud email account has a dedicated storage space. By managing your storage space properly, you can avoid it becoming full, also known as “overquota”. By default, the emails you receive and send are stored on the server of your email account. You can also store your emails locally on your computer using an email client (Outlook, macOS Mail, Thunderbird, etc.).

**This guide explains how to manage and optimise the storage space of email accounts.**

## Requirements

- A preconfigured OVHcloud email solution, such as [**Hosted Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/hosted-exchange/), [**Email Pro**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/email-pro/)) or **MX Plan** (available with a [web hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/web-hosting/), a [free Start 10M hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/domains/free-web-hosting/), or ordered separately)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie)
- Login credentials for the email account concerned
