## Objective

You have mistakenly deleted one or more items (email, contact, calendar appointment) and emptied your "trash". You can still restore these items up to 14 days after they have been deleted via OWA (Outlook Web Application).

**This guide explains how to restore deleted items from your email account via webmail (OWA)**
 
## Requirements
 
- An OVHcloud email solution:
    - **MX Plan** ([new version only](https://docs.ovh.com/us/en/emails/web_hosting_an_overview_of_ovh_email/)), available as part of our [web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/web-hosting/)
    - [**Hosted Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/emails/hosted-exchange/)
- Login details for the email account concerned

## Instructions

### Retention

Deleted item retention (deleted from "Trash" / "Deleted Items" folders) is available for 14 days for the following items:

- Email
- Contact
- Calendar
- Tasks

Deleted items can be recovered from webmail (OWA) and the Outlook email software.

> [!warning]
>
> Some deletions are not recoverable from retention, particularly if there is a sync failure between a device (email client, smartphone) and the Exchange server. In this case, items might be permanently deleted instead of being moved into the recovery space for deleted items.
