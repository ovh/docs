## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched the Mail app on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you open the app for the first time:** A window will appear, asking you to `Add account`{.action}.

- **If an account has already been set up**: click on `Accounts`{.action} in the menu bar to the left, then on `Add account`{.action} in the menu that pops up on the right.

In the window that appears, click on `Advanced settings`{.action}, then select `Exchange ActiveSync`{.action} as the account type.

Enter the following information:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Email address|Enter your full email address.|
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|User name|Enter your full email address.|
|Domain|Leave this field blank.|
|Server|Enter the details of the server your Exchange service is hosted on. You will find these in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} by going to the `General information`{.action} tab for the Exchange service concerned, then the `Connection`{.action} section.|
|This server requires a secure connection (SSL)|You must leave this box ticked.|
|Account name|Enter a name that will distinguish this account from any other accounts added in your Mail application.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Sign in`{.action}. If the information is correct, Outlook will successfully connect to the account.

A window will then pop up, asking if you want to add the account. This window will highlight any changes to certain inbuilt features of your device. Take note of these changes and confirm that you want to add the account.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.
