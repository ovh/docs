## Step 1: Authorise mailbox sharing
In our example, a folder is shared from the ovhguide@support-exchange.eu account to ovhguide2@support-exchange.eu.
Firstly: authorise sharing on your account.
To do this, right-click on the account name and select "permissions" . A new window will appear.

## Step 4: Authorise mailbox sharing
You can also customise the level of access for this user by changing the permission options in the Permissions section. 

For example you may want the ovhguide2@support-exchange.eu user to only have access to the "Drafts" folder in the ovhguide@support-exchange.eu. mailbox. 

Click "OK"to confirm your selection.]

Permissions will be granted only for the file in question.

## Set up folder sharing permissions
You can now give the second user sharing permissions for a folder, such as the "Drafts" folder.

The process is almost the same as before: right-click on the "Drafts" folder, then 

click on "Permissions"

This step can be carried out for any folder.

Carry out the same actions as before by adding a user then giving them the necessary permissions for the folder in question.

You can assign different permissions: Owner, Editer, Author, User...

## Step 1: Retrieve the shared folder
The user that has been given permission must add the shared folder in [OWA](https://ex.mail.ovh.net/owa/).

To do this, right-click on your email account, then select "add shared folder".
