## Objective

An Office 365 licence can be used on 5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets and 5 smartphones. You will have constant updates, including for major releases. 

**Learn how to manage an Office 365 Reseller (CSP2) program at OVH.**

## Requirements
- You must have an OVH NIC handle (Customer ID).
-  You must be registered in our **Partner Network** programme via our website [http://partners.ovh.com/](http://partners.ovh.com/){.external}. 
- You must have Office 365 CSP2 program licences.

## Instructions

### Access Office 365 Reseller service management

Once the Office 365 service has been created and is available, you can manage it from your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

To do this, log in and go to the `Sunrise`{.action} section. In the left-hand menu, choose `Office 365 Resellers`{.action}, then select the service.

>
> If you already have an Office 365 CSP2 service with Microsoft, you can choose to delegate the administration to OVH. You can also add additional subscriptions directly from your OVH Control Panel. When ordering a new group of licences, you must choose `Delegate a platform already created with Microsoft`{.action}.
>

Furthermore, if you have a Microsoft Partner ID, you can enter it in this same interface. By doing so, you can get cashback on the subscriptions you order via our Control Panel. This cashback is subject to the rules defined by Microsoft for the number of subscriptions you generate.

### Automatically configure a domain hosted by OVH

OVH offers a tool that makes configuring domains easier. You can use it to configure your domains automatically using the OVH DNS zone, so they can work with the following solutions:

- Exchange Online
- Skype
- Intune.

To do this, select the domain in question from the drop-down list, and then select the solutions of your choice. We will then create the relevant DNS records in the domain’s OVH DNS zone.
