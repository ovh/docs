### Use email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive emails.

OVHcloud also has a web application you can use to access your email address from your browser. You can access this application at <https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/mail/>. You can log in using your email credentials. If you have any questions about how to use it, you can refer to our guide on [Using the Outlook Web App with an Exchange account](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/exchange_2016_outlook_web_app_user_guide/).

### Retrieve a backup of your email address

If you need to make any changes that could lead to the loss of your email account data, we advise backing up the email account concerned beforehand. To do this, please read the "**Export**" section in the "**Mail on macOS**" section of our guide on [Manually migrating your email address](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/emails/migrate-email-addresses-manually/#exporting).

### Modify existing settings
