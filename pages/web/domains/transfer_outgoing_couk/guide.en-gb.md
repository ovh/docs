## Prerequisites
To transfer a .co.uk domain name or equivalent to another registrar, make sure that it meets the following conditions:


- Your domain must not have expired. 
- Your domain name must not be the subject of an ongoing dispute with Nominet
- Your domain must not be blocked by OVH




## Extensions in question

- .co.uk
- .me.uk
- .org.uk
- .ltd.uk
- .plc.uk
- .uk.




## Step 1: Verify domain name information
You can find the information in your control panel [here](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login/). 
You must log in as the administrative contact.


- Once you are logged in, you just have to click on your domain name at the top-left of the Domains section, then on General information.

If for whatever reason you cannot modify your domain's TAG in your control panel, you can ask Nominet to modify it for you.
