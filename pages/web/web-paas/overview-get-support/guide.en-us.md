## Objective  

Find out how to get help if you're experiencing issues with Web PaaS.

## Create a support ticket

If you're experiencing issues related to
the proper functioning of the Web PaaS infrastructure, application container software, or build processes;
have found possible bugs; or have general questions,
open a support ticket:

1\. [Open the Management Console](https://console.platform.sh/)

2\. Select **User menu** (your name) > **Support**.

3\. Click **+ New ticket**.

4\. Fill in the ticket fields and click **Submit**.


Or use these shortcuts to [access all support tickets](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets)
or [open a new ticket](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open).

Once you submit a ticket, you see it in a list of all tickets created within your organization.
Note that once you submit the ticket, you can't modify or delete the submission.
If you have any additional information, you can select the submitted ticket and write a message.
