## Objective  


![Overview of projects in the console](images/all-projects.png "0.5")

This console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](../development-cli).

## Project list

The main console page gives you an overview of all your projects.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects or choosing a specific organization from the menu.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](./configure-project).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](./configure-environment).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.
