## Objective  

{{% multi-app-intro %}}

No matter how many apps you have in one project, they're all served by a single [router for the project](./routes.md).
To allow your apps to communicate with each other, [create relationships](./relationships.md).
Each app separately defines its relationships to [services](../../add-services),
so apps can share services or have their own.
