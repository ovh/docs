## Objective  

Web PaaS allows you to maintain your code base in a third party repository and link it to your Web PaaS project.  The remote repository is the canonical, definitive copy of your application code and the Web PaaS project is just a read-only mirror.

Note that when a source integration is enabled, you should not push code directly to the Web PaaS repository.  It will get overwritten the next time the integration is triggered.
