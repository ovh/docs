## Instructions

### Introduction

> [!warning]
>
> OVHcloud offers you Nutanix as a *Bring Your Own Licence* (BYOL) version, which means that you, as an OVHcloud customer, must provide the cluster licences.
>
> When the Nutanix cluster is ordered in BYOL mode, the cluster is delivered with a 90-day trial. As a customer, you must install your licences during this period.
>
> If you want to redeploy a cluster with the BYOL offer, you must first uninstall the licences on the cluster before launching a redeployment. This guide explains how to add or remove licences.
>

There are three types of licences for:

- **Prism Element**. 
- **Prism Central**. 
- **Add-ons**.

You can install all licences from **Prism Central**.
