## Objective

The Public Cloud Archive offer is an unlimited storage solution with simple billing tailored to your needs. There are many types of object containers:

- For static hosting (static website).
- For private hosting (e.g. storage of personal data).
- For public hosting (to store everything that is accessible to the public).
- For cold storage (archiving).

The first step is to create a container that will hold your files. 

**This guide explains how to create a container in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**
