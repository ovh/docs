## Access via the web client.

**You can access your virtual desktop through your preferred internet browser.**

To do this, go to the URL provided in the email sent after your Cloud Desktop infrastructure was delivered. Your default browser will open, and display a window where you can choose between installing the VMware Horizon Client, or using VMware Horizon HTML Access.
