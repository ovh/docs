## Objective

With the OVHcloud plugin, you can add dedicated resources to your infrastructure in just a few minutes.

**Find out how to use the OVHcloud plugin in vSphere.**

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud solution](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/){.external}
- access to the vSphere interface

## Instructions

Two dedicated resources can be billed hourly as an option:

- host servers
- datastores

In the vSphere web client, simply go to the "Host and Cluster" section, and open the tree-view on the left-hand side. You can then access the plugin menus via the `Configure`{.action} tab for the datacentre or the cluster.

The `Add Host`{.action} menu is dedicated to host servers. You can view their technical details and order new host servers here.
