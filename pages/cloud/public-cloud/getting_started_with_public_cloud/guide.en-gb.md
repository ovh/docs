## Objective

[Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/instances/){.external} offer a flexible, pay-as-you-go solution for managing virtual resources. This means that you can add and remove resources (instances, storage, etc) as and when you need to.

**This guide will show you how to create your first Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

* access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}

## Instructions

### Create a project

Log into to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}. Once you're logged in, click on the `Cloud`{.action} menu.

### Select a payment method

As mentioned earlier, the Public Cloud is a pay-as-you-go service. Once your project is created, you can buy instances, storage etc. However, when you create your first project, you'll need to choose one of the following three payment methods:

#### Register a bank card

This is the easiest method. When you register a bank card, you will automatically be debited at the start of the month. This method will allow you to register (depending on your country):

* a credit/debit card
* a PayPal account
* a bank account

> [!primary]
>
If this is your first payment with OVH, we will only accept credit cards with 3-D Secure.
>

Select your desired method from the list and click the `Add`{.action} button.

Once you've clicked the `Add`{.action} button, you'll be prompted to complete the setup of your payment method, as shown below.

#### Buy cloud credit

You can also pay for your [Public Cloud](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/instances/){.external} usage using cloud credit. Your first cloud credit purchase will cost £30. Any resources you use after this will consume your credit. When your credit is depleted, you can purchase more using any accepted payment method.

Cloud credit is non-transferable or refundable. It has no monetary value, and if it is not used within 13 months it will be lost.

#### Use a voucher

If you have a promotional code, you can add it during this stage to pay for your resources. The duration of the voucher may vary.

Once you have created your project, it will be available in the left-hand menu.

### Add an instance or storage

To add resources to your new project, click the `Actions`{.action} button on the `Infrastructure`{.action} tab.
