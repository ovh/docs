## Objective

This guide details how to set up advanced replication and disaster recovery plans with **Nutanix Leap** in **Prism Central**.

## Introduction

Nutanix Leap allows:

- Asynchronous and synchronous replication based on the chosen licence pack
- Test replicas
- Advanced disaster recovery plans with virtual machine startup and, in some cases, cluster-to-cluster failover automation (only with synchronous replication and a cluster witness)
- a destination to the Nutanix cloud with **Xi Leap** (note that this solution is not available with licences provided by OVHcloud)

> [!warning]
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that they work properly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you as much as possible with common tasks. Nevertheless, we recommend contacting a specialist provider if you experience any difficulties or doubts when it comes to managing, using or setting up a service on a server.
>

## Requirements

- Two Nutanix clusters in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- Access to your clusters via **Prism Central**
- An interconnection between two clusters, for example using these technologies:
    - via an IPsec VPN as detailed in the guide [Interconnecting IPsec between two sites](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/nutanix_on_ovhcloud/44-ipsec-interconnection)
    - or via a [vRack](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/network/vrack/) connection.
- **Prism Central** needs more resources depending on the mode:
    - Single Mode: 4GB additional RAM.
    - Scale Mode with 3 **Prism Central** virtual machines: 8 GB additional RAM per virtual machine.

## Instructions

Our Disaster Recovery Plan via **Nutanix Leap** will be set up between two clusters, both of which are located in remote OVHcloud datacentres, one in Canada and the other in France. The two clusters are connected by an IPSec VPN with this network configuration:

- Cluster administration LAN in France: **192.168.0.0/24**.
- Cluster administration LAN in Canada: **192.168.10.0/24**.

- Production LAN for VMs, common to both clusters: **192.168.50.0/24** on VLAN 50.
- Test LAN common to both clusters: **192.168.51.0/25** on VLAN 51.

### Commissioning of Nutanix Leap

#### Adding an iSCSI IP address on each cluster

Before you enable **Nutanix Leap**, you must add an IP address for iSCSI connections on each cluster.

Using **Prism Central**, connect to **Prism Element** on the cluster in France. You can use the [Nutanix Hyperconvergence guide](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/nutanix_on_ovhcloud/03-nutanix-hci) for more information.

In the top left-hand corner of the **Prism Element** dashboard, click `the cluster name`{.action}.

### Disaster Recovery Plan Management

#### Introduction 

Disaster recovery plans can be created with various options: 

- Manually launch disaster recovery plan if there is no cluster witness.
- Synchronous replication disaster recovery plan automation with a cluster witness.
- Choose how virtual machines start when the disaster recovery plan is activated with the ability to run a script.

In our example, this will be a manual disaster recovery plan that includes automatic startup of virtual machines.

In the **Primary Location** drop-down menu on the left, replace the remote cluster with `Local AZ`{.action}.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 04](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion04.png){.thumbnail}

Choose `The remote area`{.action} in **Recovery Location** on the right instead of Local AZ.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 05](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion05.png){.thumbnail}

Now that the source and destination of the disaster recovery plan have changed, click `Next`{.action}.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 06](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion06.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Proceed`{.action}.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 07](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion07.png){.thumbnail}

Select the `Virtual Machine` that you want to start during the disaster recovery plan and click `Next`{.action}.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 08](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion08.png){.thumbnail}

On the primary site, choose these options:

- **Production**: `Production VLAN`
- **Test Failback**: `Test VLAN` 

At the destination site, choose these options:

- **Production**: `Production VLAN`
- **Test Failover**: `Test VLAN` 

Then click `Done`{.action}. 

![Recovery Plan Inversion 09](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion09.png){.thumbnail}

The disaster recovery plan has been modified to allow the virtual machines in the cluster to be switched from the French to the Canadian virtual machines. 

If you want to return to the original operation, you will need to failover, change replication, and change the disaster recovery plan.

![Recovery Plan Inversion 10](images/09-recovery-plan-inversion10.png){.thumbnail}

#### Enabling disaster recovery plan following an incident on the original cluster

The disaster recovery plan is also used in the event of a problem with the original cluster. In this case, the activation will be done without the data modified since the last synchronisation.

If a synchronous replication solution is used, no data loss will occur.

In our case, replication is scheduled every 15 minutes, the risk of data loss can, in the worst case, corresponds to this duration.

From **Prism Central**, connect to the cluster that is receiving replicas.

From the main menu, choose `Recovery Plan`{.action} from the `Data Protection` submenu.

![Unplanned Recovery 01](images/10-unplanned-recovery01.png){.thumbnail}

Select the Disaster Recovery Plan with the `checkbox`{.action} and click the `Actions`{.action} button. 

![Unplanned Recovery 02](images/10-unplanned-recovery02.png){.thumbnail}

Choose `Failover`{.action} from the menu. 

![Unplanned Recovery 03](images/10-unplanned-recovery03.png){.thumbnail}

Check `Unplanned Failover`{.action} and click `Failover`{.action}

![Unplanned Recovery 04](images/10-unplanned-recovery04.png){.thumbnail}

Type `Failover` in the confirmation field and click `Failover`{.action}

![Unplanned Recovery 05](images/10-unplanned-recovery05.png){.thumbnail}

The virtual machine that is a member of the disaster recovery plan will boot to the destination cluster with the contents of the last replication.
