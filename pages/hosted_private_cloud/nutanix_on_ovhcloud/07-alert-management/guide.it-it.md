- You must be connected to the cluster via Prism Central

## Defining alerts, events, and tasks in Prism Central

Everything that happens in a cluster associated with Prism Central is recorded in the **events**.

When an anomaly occurs, such as excessive CPU usage on a virtual machine, **alerts** are triggered automatically.<br>
Prism Central alerts are in addition to Prism Element alerts.

You can add custom alerts to increase sensitivity on an item in the cluster.<br>
Alerts can be sent to recipients through e-mail.

Each action that a Prism Central user performs appears as a **task** and is listed with a *complete*, *in progress*, or *in error* status.

## Instructions

### Configuring SMTP Server in Prism Central

In order for **Prism Central** to send alerts, you must configure an SMTP server.

Click the `Gear`{.action} icon in the top right of the **Prism Central** interface to configure it.

#### Resolving an alarm

In **Prism Central**, when an alarm is triggered, a red circle appears in the top right next to a bell. This alert will disappear after 180 minutes if the threshold has returned to normal.

The trigger threshold may return to normal within 180 minutes. In this case, you can delete the alert manually.

To delete an alert manually, click the red numbered circle.
