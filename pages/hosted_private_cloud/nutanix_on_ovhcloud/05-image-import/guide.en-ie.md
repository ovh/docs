## Overview of the image system in Nutanix

Images are imported files of various formats, such as ISO images, but it is also possible to import most images of existing virtual machines (vhdx, qcow2, etc.).

Images are imported from Prism Central or Prism Element. This documentation describes how to import an image from Prism Central.

You can import images from a local file or a URL link.
