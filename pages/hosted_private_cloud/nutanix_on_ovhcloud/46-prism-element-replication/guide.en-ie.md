## Objective

This guide details how to set up cluster replication via Prism Element.

> [!warning]
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure  that they function correctly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend contacting a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/directory/) or reaching out to [our community](https://community.ovh.com/en/) if you experience any issues.

## Introduction

Via **Prism Element**, you can:

- Add links to remote clusters.
- Create protection domains to add replications to remote sites.

> [!warning]
> 
> The **Starter** pack of the Nutanix on OVHcloud packaged service allows you to use asynchronous replicas **every hour**.
>
> For a shorter replication time between 1 and 15 minutes, you must configure NearSync replicas. This option is only available with the **Pro** or **Ultimate** OVHcloud packs.
> 

## Requirements

- Two Nutanix clusters in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- Access to your clusters via **Prism Central**
- An interconnection between two clusters, e.g. via an IPsec VPN

## Instructions

We will use two Nutanix clusters in OVHcloud data centres, one in Canada and the other in France, connected via an IPsec VPN, on two different IP addressing schemes which are:

- **192.168.0.0/24** for the cluster in a data centre in France.
- **192.168.10.0/24** for the cluster in a Canadian data centre.

If you need help setting up an IPsec VPN, please refer to our guide on [interconnecting two Nutanix clusters through an IPsec VPN](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/nutanix_on_ovhcloud/44-ipsec-interconnection).

Connect via **Prism Element** to the cluster in France from **Prism Central**, as shown in this documentation: [Nutanix Hyperconvergence](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/nutanix_on_ovhcloud/03-nutanix-hci).

Click `Data Protection`{.action} from the `Home`{.action} menu.

### Setting up inter-site replication

Now that the two sites are connected, we will create a protection domain with asynchronous replication containing three virtual machines located on the cluster in France to the remote site in Canada.

Return to the clusterâ€™s **Prism Element** interface, located in France.

Choose `Data Protection`{.action} from the main `Home`{.action} menu.

![03 Create dataprotection 01](images/03-create-dataprotection01.png){.thumbnail}

In the **Data Protection** dashboard, click `+ Protection Domain`{.action} in the top right-hand corner, then `Async DR`{.action}.

![03 Create data protection 03](images/03-create-dataprotection03.png){.thumbnail}

Name the protection domain and click `Create`{.action}.

![03 Create dataprotection 04](images/03-create-dataprotection04.png){.thumbnail}

Select three virtual machines and click `Protect Selected Entities`{.action}.

![03 Create dataprotection 05](images/03-create-dataprotection05.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Next`{.action}.

![03 Create dataprotection 06](images/03-create-dataprotection06.png){.thumbnail}

Click `New Schedule`{.action} to configure the schedule.

![03 Create dataprotection 07](images/03-create-dataprotection07.png){.thumbnail}

Modify this option to **Configure your local schedule**:

- Enter **Repeat every** `1 hour`. 

Then enter the retention policies in **Retention policy**:

- Choose locally and remotely **keep the last** `2` **snapshots** to keep two snapshots locally and remotely.

Click `Create Schedule`{.action} to commit the schedule.

![03 Create dataprotection 08](images/03-create-dataprotection08.png){.thumbnail}

The replication task is created to run hourly. This will be asynchronous replication, which can be used with the OVHcloud **Starter** pack. 

Click `Close`{.action} to close the window.

> [!primary]
> 
> You can change the schedule to reduce the risk of data loss in the event of a disaster, but replication will switch from asynchronous to *NearSync* mode, and you will then need to upgrade your licence to the OVHcloud **Pro** or **Ultimate** packs.

![03 Create dataprotection 09](images/03-create-dataprotection09.png){.thumbnail}

The protection domain is created and appears in the list.

![03 Create data protection 10](images/03-create-dataprotection10.png){.thumbnail}

### Virtual machine migration

Migrating VMs is an operation to move VMs that are members of a protection domain to the remote site without losing data. Both clusters must be online and communicate correctly with each other. 

The migration steps are as follows:

1. Stopping virtual machines on the source cluster (if they are turned on).
2. Replication of missing data to destination cluster.
3. Deleting virtual machines on the source cluster.
4. Disable scheduling.
5. Enabling virtual machines on the destination cluster.
6. Replication is reversed, the destination becomes the source.

Go to the **Prism Element** interface where the replicated virtual machines are located.

In the **Data Protection** dashboard, click `Migrate`{.action}. 

![04 Migrate VM to Canada 01](images/04-migrate-to-canada01.png){.thumbnail}

Select the remote site, type `MIGRATE`, and click `Migrate`{.action}.

![04 Migrate VM to Canada 02](images/04-migrate-to-canada02.png){.thumbnail}

The migration is then launched. It will be completed when the VMs appear at the remote site and are no longer visible at the original site. 

Since the migrated virtual machines are turned off, you must start them manually.

### Virtual machine failover in case of disaster

If the original site is down, you can enable virtual machines that are members of a protection domain at the destination site. 

> [!warning]
> Activation of virtual machines at the remote site will be done with the latest replicated data. For asynchronous replication, the maximum data loss risk is one hour.

Connect to the functional site with **Prism Element**.

Go to the **Data Protection** dashboard.

Select the site to activate and click `Activate`{.action}. 

![05 Active VM on remote site 01](images/05-activate-protection-domain01.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Yes`{.action}. 

![05 Active VM on remote site 02](images/05-activate-protection-domain02.png){.thumbnail}

The virtual machines will appear in the **Prism Element** console in the state of last replication. Data modified after the last valid replication will be lost.
