## Requirements

- A Nutanix cluster in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- You must be connected to the cluster via Prism Central
- You need to know the Prism Element admin password (when deploying a Nutanix cluster by OVHcloud this password is created in the same way as Prism Central but can be changed later)

## Overview

You can deploy Prism Central in a custom sizing with these options:

- Small with 6 vCPU, 26GB of memory and 500GB of storage per virtual machine.
- Large with 10 vCPU, 44 GB of memory and 2500GB of storage per virtual machine.
- X-Large with 14 vCPU, 60GB of memory and 2500GB of storage per virtual machine.

By default, Prism Central is deployed on Nutanix by OVHcloud on a single virtual machine in *Small* mode.

When redeploying a cluster from the OVHcloud Control Panel, you can configure Prism Central with one or three virtual machines in *small* mode only.

## Instructions

We will look at how to replace Prism Central in Small mode on a single virtual machine with a Prism Central in X-Large mode and then extend Prism Central on 3 virtual machines for more resilience.<br>
The Nutanix cluster remains operational during this operation but the features that require **Prism Central** will be removed.

### Configuring SSH access to Prism Element with the OVHcloud Load Balancer

```

### Replacing the Prism Central virtual machine with an X-Large machine

Run these commands after you have modified the following information:

- **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central
- **\<Prism-Element-Admin-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password
- **\<Prism-Central-VM-Name\>** : Prism Central VM name

```bash
# Disconnect Prism Element in Prism Central
ncli multicluster remove-from-multicluster external-ip-address-or-svm-ips=<Prism-Central-Private-IP-address> username=admin password=<Prism-Element-Admin-Password> force=true
# Delete VM
acli vm.delete <Prism-Central-VM-Name>
```

Next, connect to an AHV host in the cluster with this command.

```bash
ssh root@private-ip-address-of-one-ahv-servers
```

Run this command to retrieve the UUID of your default storage, once you have modified the following information:

- **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
- **\<Prism-Element-IP\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X GET "https://<Prism-Element-Ip>:9440/PrismGateway/services/rest/v2.0/storage_containers/" | jq -r '[.entities[] | select( .name | contains("default-container")) | .storage_container_uuid][0]'
```

Next, run this other command to retrieve the UUID of your cluster’s administration network, with the same elements you modified for the previous command:

```bash
curl -s -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST https://<prism6element-IP>:9440/api/nutanix/v3/subnets/list -d {} | jq -r "[.entities[] | select( .spec.name | contains(\"<subnet name>\")) | .metadata.uuid][0]"
```

Create a file named **PrismCentralXlarge.json** with the information below :

```json
{
    "resources": {
        "version": "pc.2022.6.0.1",
        "should_auto_register": false,
        "initial_password": "<Prism-Central-Password>",
        "pc_vm_list": [
            {
                "vm_name": "prism-central",
                "container_uuid": "<Default-Container-UUID>",
                "num_sockets": 14,
                "data_disk_size_bytes": 2684354560000,
                "memory_size_bytes": 64424509440,
                "nic_list": [
                    {
                        "ip_list": [
                            "<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address>"
                        ],
                        "network_configuration": {
                            "network_uuid": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-UUID>",
                            "subnet_mask": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-mask>",
                            "default_gateway": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-Gateway>"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Replace these items in the file :

- **\<Prism-Central-Password\>** : Password for the future Prism Central virtual machine.
- **\<Default-Container-UUID\>** : UUID of the default storage retrieved earlier.
- **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central.
- **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-UUID\>** : Nutanix Cluster Administration Network UUID.
- **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-mask\>** : Nutanix cluster administration network subnet mask.
- **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-Gateway\>** : Nutanix cluster administration network default gateway.

Run this command to deploy your Prism Central virtual machine in X-Large mode, once you changed these settings:

- **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
- **\<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST "https://<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address>:9440/api/nutanix/v3/prism_central" -d @PrismCentralXlarge.json
```

> [!warning]
> Wait thirty minutes for this virtual machine to deploy.
>

Enter the following command by editing these options to create a **pcregister.json** file:

- **\<Prism-Central-Password\>** : Prism Central Password.
- **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central.

```bash
echo "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"<Prism-Central-Password>\",\"port\":9440,\"ipAddresses\":[\"<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address>\"]}" > pcregister.json
```

Run this command to save Prism Element into your new Prism Central virtual machine, after changing these settings :

- **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
- **\<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST "https://<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address>:9440/PrismGateway/services/rest/v1/multicluster/prism_central/register" -d @pcregister.json
```

Prism Element is now saved in the new Prism Central.

### Migration of Prism Central to 3 virtual machines

Now that Prism Element is attached to your Prism Central virtual machine, you will connect to Prism Central and extend Prism Central to three virtual machines.

Log in to Prism Central with the URL provided during deployment.

Enter your Personal Information, check the box `I have read and agree to the terms and conditions`{.action} and click `Accept`{.action}.
