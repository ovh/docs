## Objective

Nutanix provides a tool called **Nutanix Move** that allows migrations from other environments to **AHV**.

**This guide explains how to perform a migration with the Move software.**

> [!warning]
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that they work properly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you as much as possible with common tasks. Nevertheless, we recommend contacting a specialist provider if you experience any difficulties or doubts when it comes to managing, using or setting up a service on a server.
>
> Some options, such as the use of compression or deduplication, require specific licences provided by Nutanix through OVHcloud. Please contact OVHcloud Sales for more information.

## Requirements

- A Nutanix cluster in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- You must be connected to the cluster via Prism Central
- A connection to an environment other than Nutanix 

## Nutanix Move Overview

**Nutanix Move** is a tool that allows virtual machine migrations from **VMware ESXI**, **Hyper-V**, **Azure** and **AWS** to **AHV**.

It can also be used to migrate from Nutanix **AHV** to **AWS**.

This software works on a virtual machine whose sources are available on the Nutanix website with a customer account.

For optimal use, we recommend installing **Nutanix Move** as close as possible to the destination.

The **Nutanix Move** software is the only software that communicates between the source and the destination.

> [!warning]
> It is strongly discouraged to use **Nutanix Move** with virtual machines on a Windows Server running **Active Directory** or **Microsoft Exchange**. It is best to migrate as recommended by Microsoft.
>
> For VMs that use databases in **Microsoft SQL**, it is best to stop the database service when completing a migration.
>
> Ensure that the original virtual machine is compatible with the destination Nutanix environment.

## Instructions

We will look at how to migrate between a remote environment on Hyper-V to an OVHcloud Nutanix environment.

The source and the destination are on two interconnected private networks through an **IPSEC VPN**.

### Preparing the original virtual machines before migration

The virtual machine must be in the list of supported virtual machines in the compatibility matrix for the migration to work.

Log in to the site below to verify the compatibility of the source machines with the destination environment on Nutanix:

[Nutanix Accounting Matrix](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/compatibility-interoperability-matrix/guestos)

#### Specificity of virtual machines on LINUX

Some virtual machines will not start correctly after migration via **Nutanix Move**.<br>
Check the compatibility list as it is likely that the SCSI driver is not supported and needs to be changed with the PCI driver.
<br>
In this case, you will need to follow this procedure to [change the disk controller of a Virtual Machine](#changediskcontroller) after the virtual machine is migrated.

#### Specificity of the Microsoft environment

Microsoft does not provide the SCSI adapter and network card **Virtio** drivers. These drivers must be installed prior to a migration. These drivers are available on the Nutanix website with a customer account.

> [!primary]
> Microsoft Windows 2008 is no longer supported by Microsoft or Nutanix. However, you can install older **Virtio** drivers and attempt a migration.
>

Login to the Nutanix website with a customer account to download the VIRTIO drivers.

[VIRTIO driver download link](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/downloads?product=ahv&bit=VirtIO).

![Cut Over 03](images/CutOver06.PNG){.thumbnail}

#### Changing the Disk Controller on a Linux Virtual Machine <a name="changediskcontroller"></a>

If the virtual machine does not start properly after the migration, it may be due to a bad disk controller in the virtual machine configuration. In this case, it should be changed by following this procedure: 

Go to the main menu of **Prism Central** and click on `VMs`{.action}.

![Change Disk Controller 01](images/ChangeVMDiskController01.PNG){.thumbnail}

Make sure the virtual machine is turned off.
