excerpt: Using NAT rules to redirect traffic

## Objective

NAT stands for network address translation. Itâ€™s a way to map multiple addresses to a single one.      
There are two types of NAT:

- DNAT stands for Destination NAT. It modifies the destination address and is used for inbound traffic.
- SNAT stands for Souce NAT. It modifies the source address and is used for outbound traffic.

**This guide explains how to create NAT rules.**

## Requirements

- being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- a user account with access to vSphere as well as the specific rights for NSX (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))
- a deployed [NSX Edge Services Gateway](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx_deploying_edge_gateway)

## Instructions
