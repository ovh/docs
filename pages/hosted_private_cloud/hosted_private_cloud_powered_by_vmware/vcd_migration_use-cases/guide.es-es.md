## Objective

**The goal is to provide a list of complex use cases, and the solutions to implement in order to migrate in VCD.**

## Requirements

- Have a Hosted Private Cloud managed VMware product on OVHcloud.
- Access to OVHcloud [control panel](/links/manager).
- You must have completed the verification steps in the following guide before launching a migration to VCD.
- To not use Zerto on OVHcloud backup replication solutions (for now).
- Do not require PCI-DSS, SNC or HDS certification (for now).
- To not have data (VMs, vApp) that need to be migrated on multiple datacenters (multi-vDC use-case, solution bellow) with your VMware on OVHcloud product offer.

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> This audit is mandatory before any possible migration to VCD on OVHcloud.
>

This how-to guide will provide you information and solutions with the purpose of migrating your OVHcloud managed VMware vSphere services to a OVHcloud managed VMware Cloud Director ecosystem.

This document also details the requirements for each use-cases, and if applicable, explains how to comply with them.

### Step 1 - Requirements and special cases (mandatory)

Once you have fulfilled these requirements, the OVHcloud teams will migrate the VMs in the main vSphere datacentre using a hot migration path.

This hot migration will minimize disruptions from your public or private networks. Private networks are the most likely to be affected, with downtime of the order of a few minutes.

##### Table - Special cases

The table below lists each of the migration bottlenecks and criticality levels that must be remediated before the migration can begin.
