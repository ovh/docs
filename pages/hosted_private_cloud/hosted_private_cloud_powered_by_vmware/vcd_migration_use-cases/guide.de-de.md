## Objective

**The purpose of this guide is to provide you with the information you need to migrate to a VMware Cloud Director on OVHcloud environment.**

## Requirements

- A managed [VMware vSphere on OVHcloud](/links/hosted-private-cloud/vmware) offer.
- You must have access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and be technical administrator of the managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud infrastructure.

## Instructions

This practical guide is designed to provide you with information and solutions on the process of migrating your managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud services to a managed VMware Cloud Director on OVHcloud solution.

It also details the requirements for each use case, and if applicable, explains the requirements for a migration.

| ![VCD Migration Block](images/vcd_migration_bloc_validation_en.png){thumbnail} | 1. Before migrating, it is important to read the checklist of specific use cases below and follow any associated recommendations.<br/>2. Once you have met these requirements, you can log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel to sign (in the provided field for this purpose) the specific conditions (T&Cs) of the environment which will be migrated. A confirmation email will be sent, containing a link and a temporary password to access VCD on OVHcloud. <br/>3. OVHcloud teams will migrate VMs from the chosen datacenter (vDC), using a hot migration path (vMotion).<br/> |

This hot migration will minimize disruptions to your public or private networks. Private networks are the most likely to be affected, with downtime of the order of a few minutes.

Your virtual machines will remain operational during the migration, with no downtime. However, there is a risk that some network packets will be lost during vMotion.

This migration should be done with no noticeable impact for most applications, but we recommend that you monitor them closely throughout the process.

As a reminder, if you decide to switch to the managed VCD on OVHcloud offer, the new prices will not be applied to your existing servers/hosts. We will cover the increase of licensing prices until the migration is complete.

### Step 1 - Before migration (mandatory)

**Important**: The Particular Terms and Conditions (C&P) available since the beginning of September 2024 in the OVHcloud Control Panel must be signed for the migration to be carried out by the OVHcloud teams.

Please review the product demo and webinar to familiarize yourself with this new offering.

You can find all the information you need on our VCD pages:

- [OVHcloud Labs - VMware Cloud Director on OVHcloud](https://labs.ovhcloud.com/en/vmware-cloud-director/)

Migrations will be carried out in 4 waves, from september, depending on the services active in your environment.

The planned schedule, which is compatible with these environments during the migration, is as follows:

| **Waves**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |             **Dates**              | **Target<br/>Offers** |  **NSX**   |  **vRack**  | **Microsoft<br/>(SPLA)** | **Summary of migration compatible environments**                                                                                                         |

During this process, your data will remain unchanged, except for vSAN Storage. Your IP addresses will also remain unchanged.

The migration date will be sent to you by email at least 15 days before the migration starts.

We recommend reading our guide [VMware Cloud Director - The fundamentals of VCD](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-get-concepts) to see which features are included in each migration wave of your environments.

#### Managed Veeam for VCD (mandatory)

Backup is not set up by default following the VCD migration. You must subscribe to the **Managed Veeam for VCD** backup service in the control panel and configure it, if you want to protect your new environment.

**Storage repository configuration**

These settings can be customized to suit your chosen service levels:

| **Repository**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  **Target Offer**  | **Comments**                                                                          |

All these repositories have a storage quota of **100 TB**. You can contact the [support](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm?id=csm_get_help) teams to increase this quota.
