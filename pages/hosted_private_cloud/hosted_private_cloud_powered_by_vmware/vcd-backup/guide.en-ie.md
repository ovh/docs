## Objective

**This guide will show you how to back up and restore the Veeam Data Platform VCD plugin.**

## Requirements

- An administrator vCloud Director account with a VCD Organization
- A user with the Organization Administrator role to connect to the Veeam Data Platform Self-Service Portal (the new admin user in a virtual datacentre has the default role).
- You need to have read the VCD guides:
    - [VCD Basic concepts](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-get-concepts)
    - [How to log in to your organization](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-logging)
    - [How to use the VCD user interface](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-getting-started)
- You must be familiar with how Veeam Backup works

## Instructions

Veeam Data Platform supports VCD. It uses the VMware Cloud Director API to back up the vApps and VMs and restore them directly in the VMware Cloud Director hierarchy.

The Veeam Data Platform service is available and ready to use for all 3 OVHcloud solutions (see the [features catalog](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-get-concepts#key-features).

> [!warning]
>
> For the image processing and guest file system indexing options (compatible with the Veeam application) to work with WindowsÂ® virtual machines, the latest VMware tools must be installed. Linux VMs do not support application recognition or guest file system indexing.
>
> If you are using application-aware image processing for MS SQL or Oracle database backups, application-aware and item recovery options will not be supported. A full restore of the virtual machine must be performed, this implies a downtime window for all database users. You cannot manually restart an immutable backup failure. You must run an active full backup or wait for the next scheduled backup to run (see [Veeam documentation for more information](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/vcloud_manage_backup.html?ver=120)).


### Step 1 - Backup

#### Access the Veeam Data Platform administration console

The **Veeam Data Platform** service has a VCD plugin to back up VMs and vApps from any Virtual Data Center (VDC) in the organization. It is available at the organization level for any VMware Cloud Director user with the organization administrator role.

When using VCD Data Protection integration with Veeam to create backup jobs, you can choose any VM instance from any virtual datacentre in the organization.

To access the Data Protection Portal with Veeam from Cloud Director, log in to the VCD Client Portal with a vCloud Director account with the appropriate rights.

In the menu of the top center bar, click `More`{.action} and select `Data Protection with Veeam`{.action}

### Back up with Veeam Data Platform

#### Data included in backups

When Veeam Backup & Replication performs backups of vApp and VMs, it also captures vApp metadata.

The metadata for virtual applications (vApp) and VMs includes:

- General information on the **vApps** (virtual applications) where the VMs reside, such as: **Name of the vApps**, **descriptions**, **description of the VMs**.
- Information on the **vApp** networks and the organizational networks to which the vApp is connected.
- The startup options of the **VM** (VM Startup options).
- User information.
- Lease.
- The quota.
- Storage templates.

The vApp/VM metadata is stored with the virtual machine content. Capturing vApp/VM metadata is important for recovery: without it, you will not be able to restore vApps and VMs to VMware Cloud Director.

#### Repositories

By default, you have the following **repositories**:

1. **Bronze Repository**: Standard Object Storage.
2. **Silver Repository**: Standard Object Storage + Offsite Backup.
3. **Gold Repository**: High Performance Object Storage + Offsite Backup.

These repositories have a storage size of **100GB**.

#### Backup jobs

Backup jobs require 4 default settings:

1. Job parameters: Name / Deposit or Quota (Bronze/Silver/Gold: 100GB) / Description / Retention (Days/Restore point)
2. Virtual machines (VMs): Add or exclude virtual machines/vApp/vCloud Organization
3. Guest Processing: Application-aware processing / Guest file system indexing / Guest operating system credentials
4. Email notifications: Enabling email notifications

For virtual machines managed by VMware Cloud Director, Veeam Backup & Replication offers a special type of backup job: VMware Cloud Director backup jobs. VMware Cloud Director backup jobs process VMware Cloud Director objects, ensure their proper recovery, and support for Cloud Director-specific functionality.

We recommend using the VMware Cloud Director backup jobs to back up the virtual machines managed by VMware Cloud Director. If you back up VMs managed by VMware Cloud Director using a regular backup job, Veeam Backup & Replication will perform a backup at the underlying vCenter server and will not capture the vApp metadata. As a result, you will not be able to restore a fully functional virtual machine on VMware Cloud Director.

#### How do I create a backup job with the Veeam Data Platform?

You are about to create your first backup job using the Veeam Data Platform VCD plugin:

In the Veeam VCD console, click `More`{.action} and select `Data Protection with Veeam`{.action}

![VCD access to Veeam Backup](images/vcd_veeam_backup.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Jobs`{.action} then `Create`{.action}

![VCD Backup Job Veeam creation](images/vcd_veeam_backup_job_creation.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that opens, specify the backup job name, description, and retention policy. Once you have defined the elements (Job name, description, retention), click `Next`{.action}.

![VCD Backup Job Veeam creation](images/vcd_veeam_backup_jobs.png){.thumbnail}

You then need to choose your virtual machine (VM). To do this, click `Add`{.action}.

![VCD Backup Job Veeam creation](images/vcd_veeam_backup_job_creation_3.png){.thumbnail}

You can drill down into your VMware Cloud Director organization and select your VM.

Click `Next`{.action}.

### Step 2 - Restore

#### How do I restore a VM with the Veeam VCD plugin?

Veeam Backup has several restore features:

- File Level Restoration
- Instant Recovery
- Application Awareness
- The strategy per VM (Policies)
- The 3 repositories with storage class
- Immutability (optional)

#### Data included in restores

Veeam Backup & Replication enables full recovery of VMs to VMware Cloud Director. You can restore separate VMs to vApps, as well as VM data.

For recovery, Veeam Backup & Replication uses VM metadata stored in a backup file and restores VM-specific attributes. As a result, you get a fully functional virtual machine in VMware Cloud Director, you do not need to import the restored virtual machine into VMware Cloud Director and adjust the settings manually.

The backed-up objects can be restored to the same VMware Cloud Director hierarchy or to a different VMware Cloud Director environment. Restore options include:

- Instant Recovery: **Instant Recovery**
- Full restore for vApps and VMs: **Full restore for vApps and VMs**
- Restoration of VM disks: **VM files**
- Restoration of VM files: **VM disks**
- Restoring guest OS files for VMs: **Item recovery**

In this case, perform a **Full (full/full)** restore.

#### Full restoration of a VM (virtual machine)

With the OVHcloud Managed Backup service, you can restore standard VMs that are part of vApps, and standalone VMs that have been created in your OVHcloud VMware Cloud Director portal.

When you restore normal or standalone VMs in the vCloud Director hierarchy, the restoration process includes the following steps:

- Veeam uses the captured vApp metadata to define the vApp settings and the original location of the virtual machine in the VMware Cloud Director hierarchy.
- Veeam restores the VMs in the backup file to their original location or to another location. In addition, Veeam restores all VM settings.

#### How do I restore a virtual machine using the Veeam Data Platform VCD plugin?

To perform a full restore, click `Entire VM Restore`{.action}

![VCD_Veeam_restore_vm_1](images/vcd_veeam_restore_vm.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, click `Restore to the original location`{.action} to restore a full VM.

Then click `Next.`{.action}.

![VCD_Veeam_restore_vm_2](images/vcd_veeam_restore_vm_2.png){.thumbnail}

In the final step, click `Finish`{.action}. If you wish, you can also launch the VM by ticking the `Power on VM automatically`{.action} box.
