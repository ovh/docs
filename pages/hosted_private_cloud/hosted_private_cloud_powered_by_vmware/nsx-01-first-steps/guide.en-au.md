title: Getting started with NSX
excerpt: Discover NSX, the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solution provided by VMware.

## Objective

NSX is a **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** solution provided by VMware. OVHcloud is offering this service in place of NSX-V in its VMware on OVHcloud solution. For the ALPHA version of NSX to work, two hosts are deployed with a dedicated virtual machine for NSX on each host, allowing redundancy in the event of one of the hosts failing.

When a customer subscribes to the NSX offer and enables it, a pre-configuration is applied with two gateways:

- **ovh-T0-gw** : This gateway is the network entry point for your cluster. It is preconfigured with two interfaces and a virtual IP address. It is of type **Tier-0 Gateways** (North-South). 
- **ovh-T1-gw** : This gateway is in the **Tier-1 Gateways** (East-West) category. You can create segments (VLANs or Overlay) that will be connected to it. It is connected to **ovh-T0-gw** for connections outside the clusters (Physical and Internet).

New **Tier-1 gateways** can be created and linked to the **ovh-T0-gw** gateway.

OVHcloud provides a block of 16 public IP addresses, all of which are reserved for OVHcloud products. The **HA VIP** address is preconfigured and is used for SNAT by default on future internal segments.

> [!warning]
>
> This IP block is linked to the VMware environnement, you can't move or park it.

You should consider [ordering a new IP Block](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/ajout_de_bloc_ip) if you want to be able later to migrate from one VMware on OVHcloud environement to another one, or if your Disaster Recovery Plan requires moving the IP Block.

By default, routes are not enabled. The segments created behind the **ovh-T1-gw** gateway can communicate with each other but not beyond.

**This guide is an introduction to NSX.**

> [!warning]
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that they work properly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you as much as possible with common tasks. However, we recommend contacting a [specialist provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-au/directory/) if you experience any difficulties or doubts when it comes to managing, using or setting up a service on a server.

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials.
- A user account with access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

## Instructions

### Logging in to the NSX administration interface

You can connect to NSX from the URL of your cluster, provided by OVHcloud, in the form `https://pcc-xxxxx.ovh.xx`.

From the homepage for your cluster, click the `NSX`{.action} icon.

![01 NSX Connection 01](images/01-nsxt-connection01.png){.thumbnail}

Enter your credentials and click `LOG IN`{.action}.

> [!warning]
> To authenticate on the NSX interface, you need to use a vSphere account with NSX rights. Ensure that the Dedicated Cloud name (FQDN, in the form `pcc-x-x-x-x.ovh.xx`) is selected in the login form.
>
> If you are not using the NSX interface, but rather the API or another external tool (such as VMware Cloud Director, VCD), you will need to use the account provided by OVHcloud as an identifier, followed by the PCC FQDN. For example `login@pcc-1-2-3-4.ovh.eu` in the example below.

The NSX interface appears.

### Displaying the default configuration

We will see the network topology configured by default when deploying the **NSX** service.

In the **NSX** interface, click on the `Networking`{.action} tab.

![02 Display network topology 01](images/02-display-network-topology01.png){.thumbnail}

A view of all network elements is displayed.

Click `Network Topology`{.action} to the left.

![02 Display network topology 02](images/02-display-network-topology02.png){.thumbnail}

The diagram below shows the network topology from top to bottom:

- The two physical interfaces that allow redundancy of Internet access in case of failure (both interfaces use public IP addresses that are not usable for client configuration).
- The North-South gateway (**ovh-T0-gw**) that provides the link between the physical network (Internet and VLAN on vRack) and the internal networks (Overlays) of your cluster.
- The connection between the **ovh-T0-gw** and **ovh-T1-gw** gateways is via IP addresses reserved for this purpose.
- The East-West gateway (**ovh-T1-gw**) that manages communications between the clusterâ€™s internal networks (overlay segments). You can also make connections with VLANs on vRacks.
-  **ovh-segment-nsxpublic** which is a network segment connected to the OVHcloud public network on a VLAN, it contains the network of public addresses usable for customer configurations. Click the rectangular icon below to view this segment. You can find more information about segments in this guide: [Segment management in NSX](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-02-segment-management).

![02 Display network topology 03](images/02-display-network-topology03.png){.thumbnail}

This segment contains two pieces of information :

- The virtual public IP address **HA VIP**.
- The VLAN number used on your public network in your vSphere cluster.

Connections through VLANs on the **ovh-T0-gw** gateway do not appear in the NSX network topology, even if it exists.

![02 Display network topology 04](images/02-display-network-topology04.png){.thumbnail}

### Displaying the HA VIP virtual IP address

We will show you how to display the virtual IP addresses attached to the **ovh-T0-gw** gateway.

Only one virtual IP address is assigned when NSX is delivered. It is used for SNAT on the segments attached to the gateway **ovh-T0-gw**.

Stay on the `Networking`{.action} tab and click on `Tier-0 Gateways`{.action} to the left in the **Connectivity** category.

![03 Display public vip 01](images/03-display-public-vip01.png){.thumbnail}

Click the `>`{.action} scroll button to the left of **Name** to view the configuration.

![03 Display public vip 02](images/03-display-public-vip02.png){.thumbnail}

Click on the `Number`{.action} to the right of **HA VIP Configuration**.

![03 Display public vip 03](images/03-display-public-vip03.png){.thumbnail}

You see the public virtual IP address that can be used in your **NSX** configurations, click `Close`{.action} to close this window.

![03 Display public vip 03](images/03-display-public-vip04.png){.thumbnail}

### NAT Default Configuration Information

A default SNAT configuration is applied, which allows Internet access from all networks connected to the gateway **ovh-T0-gw**, those connected through VLAN segment and those overlay.

From the `Networking`{.action} tab, click `NAT`{.action} to view the default configuration of NAT rules.

The default rule for **SNAT** shows that the virtual IP address is used to translate from internal networks to the Internet.

### Route activation on all segments connected to your gateway ovh-T1-gw

By default, the segments behind the **ovh-T1-gw** gateway do not have routing enabled except with another segment connected to that gateway. We will see how to activate it if necessary.

From the **Networking** tab click on `Tier-1 Gateways`{.action} then click the `...`{.action} button to the left of the **ovh-T1-gw** gateway and choose `Edit`{.action} from the menu.

![Add route on ovh T1 01](images/05-activate-route-on-ovh-t1-gw01.png){.thumbnail}

Click the `arrow`{.action} button to the left of **Route Advertisement** and enable the **All Connected Segments & Service Ports** option. Then click `SAVE`{.action}.

![Add route on ovh T1 02](images/05-activate-route-on-ovh-t1-gw02.png){.thumbnail}

Click `CLOSE EDITING`{.action}.

![Add route on ovh T1 03](images/05-activate-route-on-ovh-t1-gw03.png){.thumbnail}

Now routing is enabled on the member segments of the **ovh-T1-gw** gateway.

You have just seen the default configuration. You can refer to the other OVHcloud guides for NSX to create segments, manage DHCP, perform DNAT port redirection, load balancing, VPN, etc...
