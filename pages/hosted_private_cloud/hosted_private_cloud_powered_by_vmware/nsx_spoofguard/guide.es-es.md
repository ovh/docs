excerpt: Set up policies to detect IP spoofing

## Objective

SpoofGuard protects against IP spoofing by maintaining a reference table of VM names and IP addresses. SpoofGuard maintains this reference table by using the IP addresses that the NSX Manager retrieves from VMware Tools when a VM initially starts.

**This guide explains how to setup Spoofguard policies.**

## Requirements

- being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/es-es/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- a user account with access to vSphere as well as the specific rights for NSX (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))
- an enabled [Distributed Firewall](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx_configurer_le_firewall_distribue)

## Instructions

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Networking and Security`{.action} dashboard.

Click on `+ Add`{.action} to create a new policy.

> [!primary]

Name and enable the policy.<br>
Choose the mode you wish to use:

- Automatically trust IP assignments on their first use
- Manually inspect and approve all IP assignment before use

> [!warning]
>
> Manual mode will block all traffic from your VMs until you validate the vNIC/IP combinations.
>

For convenience, you can also allow local address as valid address in namespace.

Click `Next`{.action}.

The policy is now on the list end enabled.<br>
