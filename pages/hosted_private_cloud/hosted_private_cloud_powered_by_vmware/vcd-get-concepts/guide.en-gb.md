## Objective

**The purpose of this page is to provide you with an overview of the features and technical limitations of services managed by OVHcloud VMware cloud Director.**

## The basic concepts

In this section, we will establish the essential foundation of VMware Cloud Director (VCD) on OVHcloud.

By defining these principles in a clear and concise way, we will provide the necessary foundation for effective and successful use of VMware Cloud Director. Whether it's for administrators looking to deploy complex infrastructure, or users looking to access resources quickly. This exploration of basic VCD concepts is a key starting point.

### Organizations

An organization is an administrative entity that groups together specific users, groups, and IT resources.

Users authenticate at the organization level by providing credentials established by an organization administrator when they are created or imported.

System administrators are responsible for creating and provisioning organizations, while organization administrators are responsible for managing users, groups, and catalogs specific to the organization.

### Users and groups

An organization can have a variable number of users and groups. Users can be created directly by the organization administrator or imported from a directory service (for example, Active Directory).

Groups must be imported from the directory service. Within an organization, permissions are managed by assigning specific rights and roles to users and groups.

### Virtual Datacentres (vDC)

A virtual datacentre can be used to offer computing resources (virtual machines/vApp/affinity rules) to an organization (your vDC), creating an environment managed by OVHcloud where virtualized systems can be stored, deployed and operated.

It is important to note that an organization may have multiple virtual datacentres (vDC) to meet their specific computing resource requirements (segmentation, isolation, security, etc.).

### Organization Virtual Datacenter Networks

A vDC network is encapsulated in a specific (virtual) datacentre created with VMware Cloud Director (VCD), and it is accessible to all of that organization’s vApps. This network allows an organization's different vApps to communicate with each other seamlessly. It can be configured to connect to an external network or kept isolated and internal to the organization.

Only system administrators have the privilege to create such networks, but organization administrators are able to manage the configurations of organization virtual datacentre networks, including the network services they offer.

### vApp networks

A vApp network is included in a vApp, and facilitates communication between the vApp’s various virtual machines.

It is possible to connect a vApp network to an organization virtual datacentre network, which allows the vApp to communicate with other vApps within the organization.

Additionally, if the organization virtual datacentre network is connected to an external network, this provides the ability for the vApp to communicate outside the organization as well.

### Catalog

Organizations use catalogs to store vApp templates and media files.

Authorized members within an organization can access these catalogs to use the vApp templates and the media files contained within them to create their own vApps.

In addition, organization administrators have the ability to copy items from public catalogs into their organization-specific catalog.
