## Objective

**This guide explains how to connect to the vSphere client.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials.
- IP addresses added in the `Security`{.action} tab of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca). For more information, please read our guide on [Authorising IP addresses for vCenter access](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/autoriser_des_ip_a_se_connecter_au_vcenter).

## Instructions

### Retrieving credentials

Login credentials are sent out by email when the Hosted Private Cloud service is created, when a password is changed or when a user profile is created.

```
Name/IP address: pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com Username: admin password: xxxxxx
```

To ensure access, please refer to the VMware documentation, in which the different ports to be opened in your firewall are listed: [Client access](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/1012382){.external}.

### Using the HTML5 web client

The HTML5 web client is available on the Hosted Private Cloud web interface at this URL: <https://pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com/ui> (replace pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com with your Hosted Private Cloud address).
