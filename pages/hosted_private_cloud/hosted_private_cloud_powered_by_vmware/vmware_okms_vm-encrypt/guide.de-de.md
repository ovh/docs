## Objective

**Find out how to order, activate and configure an OVHcloud KMS (OKMS) within a VMware vSphere managed on OVHcloud to enable the encryption policy for your virtual machines.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
- A [Hosted Private Cloud VMware vSphere on OVHcloud](/links/hosted-private-cloud/vmware) offer.
- You must have the necessary rights to manage VMware HPC resources and OVHcloud KMS with IAM.
- You must have read the following guides:
    - [KMS integration for VMware on OVHcloud](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vmware_overall_vm-encrypt).
    - [Getting started with OKMS](/pages/manage_and_operate/kms/quick-start).
- The KMS public certificate (OKMS) (see step [vCenter Trust KMS](#trust-okms)).
- A certificate signature request (CSR) generated by vSphere and signed by OKMS to trust the exchanges between the OVHcloud KMS and vCenter.

### Step 1 - Ordering an OVHcloud KMS (mandatory) <a name="command-okms"></a>

/// details | How to order an OVHcloud KMS (OKMS) for HPC VMware on OVHcloud?

![Manager KMS Menu Order Animated Gif](images/okms_order.gif){.thumbnail}.

#### Via the OVHcloud Control Panel

To access the OVHcloud KMS, log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), then go to the `Hosted Private Cloud`{.action} section. In the left-hand column, click `Identity, Security & Operation`{.action}, then `Key Management Service`{.action}.

To order a new KMS server, click the `Order a KMS`{.action} button, then `Select a region`{.action} from the two currently available:

You currently have the following regions available:

- `Europe - France Roubaix`
- `Europe - France Strasbourg`

The encryption keys and access certificates for this KMS will be stored in the specified region. They can be used for any OVHcloud product, regardless of region.

Once you have made your choice, click on the `Order`{.action} button.

> [!primary]
>
> If you were unable to complete the order, launch it manually by clicking on [this link](https://www.ovh.com/fr/order/express/#/express/review?products=~(~(productId~'okms~planCode~'okms~duration~'P1M~pricingMode~'default~configuration~(~(label~'region~value~'EU_WEST_RBX).
>

Finally, click `Finish`{.action} to finalize the order.

![Manager KMS Menu OKMS Order Finish](images/okms_order_finish-optimized.png){.thumbnail}

Once your order has been confirmed, your KMS will contain the **Name**, the **ID** and the **Region**.

![Manager KMS Menu KMS All 01](images/manager_okms_all-optimized.png){.thumbnail}

Copy your OKMS "**ID**".

![Manager KMS Menu](images/manager_okms_copy_id-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

The ID looks like a typical **UUID**. It will then be useful to:

- List your OVHcloud resources.
- List all access information (credentialId).
- Generate the "credentialId" with your CSR (the credentialId being the ID of the proof of signature of your CSR, your request for new access credentials).
- List all keys OKMS.

You can view [the table above](#listing-api).

> [!api]
>
> @api {v2} /okms POST /okms/resource/{okmsId}/credential
>

> **Settings**:
>
> - `okmsId`: Your OVHcloud KMS ID (OKMS).
>

In step 3, we will look at how to carry out these requests.

Here is a global view of your KMS order for your OVHcloud VMware vSphere managed HPC environment.

You can copy and paste all the information needed to launch the API calls (IP, URN, KMIP etc...).

![Manager KMS Menu](images/manager_okms_id-optimized-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

#### Via OVHcloud APIs

To list your OVHcloud KMS orders, use the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v2} /okms GET /okms/resource
>

> **Settings**:
>
> - `okmsId`: Your OVHcloud KMS ID (Okms).
>

Return example:

```shell
[
  {
    "id": "Null",
    "region": "EU_WEST_RBX",
    "kmipEndpoint": "eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net:5696",
    "restEndpoint": "https://eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net",
    "swaggerEndpoint": "https://swagger-eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net",
    "iam": {
      "displayName": "Null",
      "id": "Null",
      "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:okms:Null"
    }
  }
]
```

You now have an OVHcloud KMS server to set up within your managed VMware on OVHcloud environment.

///

### Step 2 - Activate OVHcloud KMS (mandatory) <a name="activation-okms"></a>

/// details | How to activate the OVHcloud KMS (OKMS) by opening traffic flows within your HPC vSphere managed on OVHcloud?

To validate the OVHcloud KMS (OKMS) with Hosted Private Cloud VMware on OVHcloud, create an inbound flow opening rule (firewall) within your VMware vSphere on OVHcloud HPC gateway.

This step must be completed **immediately** after you have ordered your KMS (OVHcloud) **and before** the KMS has been added to the managed VMware vSphere web interface.

#### Via the OVHcloud Control Panel

**Open feeds (required)**:

To create or import a KMS key management service, log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), then go to the `Hosted Private Cloud`{.action} section. In the left-hand column, click on `VMware`{.action}, then select the service concerned. On the page that pops up, click on the `Security`{.action} tab.

![Manager Hpc Security KMS](images/manager_hpc_security-opti.png){.thumbnail}

Then go further down in the `Virtual Machine Encryption Key Management Servers`{.action} section.

You will need to add your KMS via the [control panel](/links/manager) **immediately** after you have purchased and delivered your OVHcloud KMS. This is to allow flows within OVHcloud firewalls to be authorized.

![Manager Hpc Security KMS](images/manager_hpc_kms_add-optimized.png){.thumbnail}

You can add your OKMS from the HPC control panel, by clicking `Add a new KMS server`{.action}

In the new window that pops up, fill out the following forms:

- **IP**: Please use the IP address, as the domain name cannot be added. For example, use the IP address `137.74.127.152` for the region of **Strasbourg** and the IP address `91.134.128.102` for the region of **Roubaix**.
- **Description**: Enter a description for your OKMS.
- **SSL Thumbprint**: Enter the SSL/TLS Thumbprint of your OKMS.

To retrieve the TLS fingerprint, launch the following OpenSSL command (adapt your OKMS endpoint to the right region (e.g. eu-west-rbx/sbg), which includes your OVHcloud KMS):

```shell
openssl s_client -connect eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net:5696 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdin
---
Return:
SHA1 Fingerprint=FE:21:E2:DE:B7:51:34:E9:9A:AB:E0:27:FF:1E:42:3A:15:9C:76:47
```

To retrieve the public IP of the OVHcloud KMS server, launch a ping. For example:

```shell
ping eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net
```

This is the IP of the Roubaix KMS and its TLS fingerprint. Adapt the command above to suit the region where your KMS is located (Strasbourg, for example).

![Manager HPC Security KMS Add 02](images/manager_hpc_kms_add_2-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

Please check that the following confirmation is ticked before you continue : **"I have read and understood the VM Encryption documentation and the actions I will need to carry out on my own"**.

![Manager HPC Security KMS Add 02_2](images/manager_hpc_kms_add_2_2.png){.thumbnail}

Wait for the streams to open and change the status to green `delivered`.

At the same time, check your rights within IAM. To use KMS, you will need additional rights.

To do this, go to the `Users`{.action} tab of your HPC managed vSphere. In the table that opens, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the user concerned, then on `Modify`{.action}.

![Manager HPC Security KMS Add 02](images/manager_users_edit.png){.thumbnail}

Verify that the `Encryption management`{.action} is enabled.

![Manager HPC Security KMS Add 02](images/manager_users_edit_encryption.png){.thumbnail}

If you are using a particular IAM role with a global policy within your HPC managed vSphere, enable encryption management for that role. If this is the role created when IAM was enabled (iam-admin), the role has default encryption management.

With your policy, ensure that the users, resources, actions and product types of your HPC VMware vSphere managed on OVHcloud have been added.

IAM policy example:

- **Identity**: local user XX -> OVHcloud local user.
- **User groups**: ADMIN, XXXX-XX-XX/user_iam.
- **Resources**: pcc-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX (reference for your managed vSphere).
- **Product type**: iam_ressources_type_okms/kmip.
- **Actions**: vSphere Admin, pccVMware:apiovh:vmEncryption/kms/changeProperties, pccVMware:vSphere:assumeRole?iam-admin -> User vSphere iam-admin, okms:kmip:get, okms:apikms:serviceKey/create etc..

For your information, the **domain ID** corresponds to the URN of your OVHcloud KMS.

#### Via OVHcloud APIs (optional)

If you have already opened the streams from the [control panel](/links/manager), you can use the following API call (optional).

**Opening flows step**:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud POST /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/vmEncryption/kms
>

> **Settings**:
>
> - `serviceName`: Enter the reference of your managed vSphere. Example: **pcc-XX-XX-XX-XX**.
> - `description`: Enter the description of your OKMS.
> - `ip`: Enter the public IP address of your OKMS.
> - `sslThumbprint`: Enter the TLS fingerprint of your OKMS.
>

Copy and paste (with KMS settings):

```shell
{
"description": "Okms demo",
"ip": "91.134.128.102",
"sslThumbprint": "FE:21:E2:DE:B7:51:34:E9:9A:AB:E0:27:FF:1E:42:3A:15:9C:76:47"
}
 ```

To retrieve the KMS TLS fingerprint, run the following command **OpenSSL**, adapting the command to the region where your KMS is located:

```shell
openssl s_client -connect eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net:5696 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdin
---
Back:
SHA1 Fingerprint=FE:21:E2:DE:B7:51:34:E9:9A:AB:E0:27:FF:1E:42:3A:15:9C:76:47
```

To retrieve the public IP of the OVHcloud KMS, ping it by adapting the command to the region where your KMS is located:

```shell
ping eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net
```

To update your KMS with an OVHcloud KMS:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud POST /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/vmEncryption/kms/{kmsId}/changeProperties
>

> **Settings**:
>
> - `kmsId`: Enter the ID of your OKMS server. (Example: 350)
> - `serviceName`: Enter the name of your managed vSphere. Example: pcc-XX-XX-XX-XX.
>

Example:

```shell
 {
"description": "description test",
"sslThumbprint": "FE:21:E2:DE:B7:51:34:E9:9A:AB:E0:27:FF:1E:42:3A:15:9C:76:47"
}
```

Return:

After running the API, you should see the following result in response:

```shell
{
  "kmsId": XXX,
  "kmsTcpPort": 5696,
  "sslThumbprint": "Null",
  "description": "OKMS description",
  "state": "delivered",
  "ip": "Null"
}
```

Wait (status: updating) for the streams to open and for the status to change to the "delivered" state (optional).

### Step 3 - Create an IAM policy <a name="iam-creation"></a>

/// details | How do I create an IAM policy to enable VM encryption?

To enable encryption within vSphere, you must have sufficient rights within your KMS resources and OVHcloud account.

If you do not already have an IAM policy created, we will create one to list the necessary steps.

You will need to log in to your [OVHcloud control panel](/links/manager).

Go to IAM by clicking on `My account > my user > IAM > Create a policy`{.action} in the top right-hand corner.

![Manager IAM Policy](images/manager_iam-resize-optim.png){.thumbnail}

Add the name of your policy, otherwise you will not be able to create it at the end.

And an intelligent description of your IAM strategy.

In `Identities`{.action}, add your local OVHcloud user (the one with which you generated the CSR from the API) by clicking `Add a user`{.action}.

![Manager IAM Policy 02](images/manager_iam_2.png){.thumbnail}

You then need to add the actions in order to generate the keys for your vSphere encryption policy.

Click in the Product type field, then add `iam_ressources_type_okms`{.action}

You can choose to add all actions or filter more finely according to your user needs.

![Manager IAM Policy 03](images/manager_iam_3.png){.thumbnail}

Finally, click `Create policy`{.action}.

![Manager IAM Policy 04](images/manager_iam_4.png){.thumbnail}

Your policy has been created. You can now enable encryption within PCC by changing the **"VM strategy"** of your virtual machines.

If you do not have a pre-established policy, explore the API control panel and determine the IAM actions required for the policy. If you already have an IAM policy, you can modify it and add the necessary actions.

### Step 5 - Create a VM storage policy (required) <a name="storage-policy"></a>

/// details | How do I create a VM storage policy to enable encryption in VMware vSphere?

In step 6, you will complete the encryption activation on a virtual machine with the OKMS using a **Storage Policy** that we will now create.

This storage policy uses host-based policies. You must have enabled `Host-based rules`{.action}, and then enabled the storage policy components.

To create a storage policy, you need to access your PCC vSphere. If you have followed the previous steps, you must already be logged in to the [control panel](/links/manager), after adding your OVHcloud KMS in [step 4](#add-okms).

You now need to go to `Policies and profiles > VM storage strategies`{.action}.

![VM Storage Policies Creation](images/vsphere_vm_policie.png){.thumbnail}

Click `CREATE`{.action} in **VM Storage Policies**.

![VM Storage Policies Creation](images/vsphere_vm_policie_2.png){.thumbnail}

The policy creation window will now open. You are in step 1 `Name and description`{.action}.

You need to determine your vCenter server, which is the PCC on which you want to create your storage strategy.

Once you have `PCC-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.ovh.XX`{.action} chosen, give it a `Name`{.action} and `Description`{.action}.

You can click `NEXT`{.action} to continue.

![VM Storage Policies Creation](images/vsphere_vm_policie-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

This brings you to step 2, **Policy structure.**

Here, we will enable **host-based policy rules**. Select the `Enable host-based rules`{.action} checkbox.

To continue, click `NEXT`{.action}.

![VM Storage Policies Creation 02](images/vsphere_vm_policie_2-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

For step 3, you must confirm the choices in the previous step by enabling validation of the storage policy component (encryption).

For the purposes of this guide, we will leave the default setting `Default encryption properties`{.action}.

You must click `Encryption`{.action}.

Then **use the storage policy component** `Default encryption properties`{.action}.

- **Storage policy component:** Default encryption properties.
- **Description**: Storage policy component for VM and virtual disk encryption.
- **Provider**: VMware encryption.
- **Allow I/O filters before encryption**: False.

For your information, these available data services may include encryption, I/O control, caching, and so on. Host-based services will be applied in addition to the data store-specific rules.

To complete step 3, click `NEXT`{.action}.

![VM Storage Policies Creation 03](images/vsphere_vm_policie_3-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

In step 4 (storage compatibility), yu have the compatibility and incompatibility of your Hosted Private Cloud VMware on OVHcloud datacentre (Dedicated Cloud).

When you have finished checking the compatibility of your storage space, click `NEXT`{action}.

![VM Storage Policies Creation 04](images/vsphere_vm_policie_4-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

Click `FINISH`{.action} to finish the last step (step 5).

Once you have created your policy, you can now enable encryption on one of your virtual machines.

![VM Storage Policies Creation 05](images/vsphere_vm_policie_5_optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

///

### Step 6 - Enabling encryption on a VM (required) <a name="activation-encryption"></a>

/// details | How do I enable encryption in a VM with the storage policy?

Locate the virtual machine (VM) you want to encrypt. Turn it off if it is on (mandatory).

Right-click the selected virtual machine to display the shortcut menu or click `ACTIONS`{.action}.

Then select `VM Policies`{.action}.

Next, choose `Modify VM storage strategies`{.action}.

This will open a window or panel where you can modify the storage policies of the VM selected.

![VM Storage Policies Encryption](images/okms_vsphere_vm_policies-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

Search for encryption or security options in storage policies to enable KMS encryption for this VM.

![VM Storage Policies Encryption 03](images/okms_vsphere_vm_policies_3-optim-resize.png){.thumbnail}

If you deploy a new VM from an OVHcloud template, you have several choices for encrypting your VM:

- **Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed.**
- **Thin Provision.**
- **Thick Provision Eager Zeroed.**

Choose the one that suits you best, if you have any doubts, use this guide: [Which disk format to choose](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/managed_bare_metal/choosing-disk-type).

Tick the `Encrypt this VM`{.action} box.

![VM Storage Policies Encryption](images/okms_vsphere_deploy_vm_policies.png){.thumbnail}

After making the necessary changes, save the changes and close the window.

You have now edited the VM storage policies and enabled KMS encryption for your server. A small padlock on your virtual machine’s summary information confirms this.

You should now clearly see a small padlock in the general view of your VM as well as in the description of the encryption.

This confirms that your policy works with the OKMS server and that encryption is **enabled**.

## Go further <a name="go-further"></a>

### Useful information - TLS/KMS <a name="useful-information"></a>

**Useful information for manipulating your TLS certificates with OpenSSL and more**

Warning: when you copy and paste your CSR, it must be formatted to work with json format.

**\n** must be added at each line break. To do this, you can launch this OpenSSL command in order to convert your certificate to pkcs12 format:

- `openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.crt -out cert_key.p12`.

**CSR decode**:

To decode your CSR, you can run this OpenSSL command with your CSR:

- `openssl req -in mycsr.csr -noout -text`.

Or use a more graphical web tool, such as: [sslshopper](https://www.sslshopper.com/csr-decoder.html).

**Certificate decode**:

- `openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout`.

**Certificate Key Matcher**:

To check if the CSR matches your certificate, you can do so with these OpenSSL commands:

```shell
openssl pkey -in privateKey.key -pubout -outform pem | sha256sum
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -pubkey -noout -outform pem | sha256sum
openssl req -in CSR.csr -pubkey -noout -outform pem | sha256sum
```

**SSL Converter**

**OpenSSL Convert PEM**:

- Convert PEM to DER: `openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der`.
- Convert PEM to P7B: `openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile certificate.cer -out certificate.p7b -certfile CACert.cer`.
- Convert PEM to PFX: `openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt`.

**OpenSSL Convert DER**

Convert DER to PEM:

- `openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem`.

**OpenSSL Convert P7B**:

- Convert P7B to PEM: `openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer`.

**Convert P7B to PFX**:

- `openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer`.
- `openssl pkcs12 -export -in certificate.cer -inkey privateKey.key -out certificate.pfx -certfile CACert.cer`.

**OpenSSL Convert PFX**:

- Convert PFX to PEM: `openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -out certificate.cer -nodes`.

**Format CSRs for VMware**

Adapt the command with your CSR file.

```shell
# Format for the OVHcloud API:
awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' file

# Format for vSphere:
awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n")}1' file
```

**Retrieve the OKMS public certificate manually (optional)**

If you encounter any difficulties during step 4 [Make vCenter trust KMS](#trust-okms), you can download it (manual download: copy the snippet return from a shell and paste it into the vSphere web interface "Download the KMS certificate").

You can launch this snippet (you need to have Python and OpenSSL installed). It allows you to export and format the public OKMS certificate.

Change the OKMS input with the URL of the correct region. You must have Python and OpenSSL installed:

```shell
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM | python3 -c "
import sys
import json
body = {}
body['cert'] = sys.stdin.read()
json.dump(body, sys.stdout)
" | python3 -c "
import sys
import json
body = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(body['cert'])
" | openssl x509 -text; echo $?
```
