title: Gateway Firewall Management in NSX
excerpt: Learn how to manage gateway firewalls

## Objective

Gateway Firewall allows filtering between internal segments and the network outside the incoming or outgoing cluster.

It works on the North-South (Tier-0 Gateways) and East-West (Tier-1 Gateways) gateways if the source or destination is not inside the cluster.

If you want to create filtering rules between internal segments, you will need to use distributed firewall using our guide on [distributed firewall management](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-05-manage-distributed-firewall).

**Learn how to manage gateway firewalls.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials.
- A user account with access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
- Having **NSX** deployed with one segment configured in your NSX configuration. You can use our guide on [segment management in NSX](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-02-segment-management) for more information.

## Instructions

We will create a strategy to improve the visibility and administration of rules based on their usefulness.

Next, we will add a rule within our strategy that blocks access to the entire external network of a cluster from a group that contains a segment (you can use our [Distributed Firewall Management](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-05-manage-distributed-firewall) guide to create groups) and **any** for the destination.

Go to the `Security`{.action} tab, select `Gateway Firewall`{.action} and click `+ ADD POLICY`{.action}.

Your rule is active on the **ovh-T0-gw** gateway, it blocks all outgoing traffic from members of the **g-segment01** group.
