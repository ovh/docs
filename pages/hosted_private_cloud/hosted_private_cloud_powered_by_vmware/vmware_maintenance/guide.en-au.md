## Objective

**This guide will explain the maintenance operations carried out by the OVHcloud teams.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
- You are the administrative or technical contact for the [VMware on OVHcloud solution](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) infrastructure.
- You have access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) or the [API console for your services](https://ca.api.ovh.com/).

## Instructions

Maintenance operations at OVHcloud are a testament to in-house expertise. It has been improved over the years to guarantee the reliability and performance of the equipment.

### Access Hosted Private Cloud operations

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) with an administrator account, and click on the `Hosted Private Cloud`{.action} tab.

Select your infrastructure under `VMware`{.action} then click on the `Operations`{.action} tab.

![Maintenance Operation](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/hosted-private-cloud/vmware/operations/maintenance.png){.thumbnail}

To see the operations in progress or refresh the old operations, use the `Refresh`{.action} button located in the top right-hand corner of the operations table.

You can change the processing date of an operation in progress by clicking on the `...`{.action} button to the right of an operation, then on `Modify the processing date`{.action}.

For more information on rescheduling a maintenance operation, please read our guide on [Rescheduling a maintenance operation on your Hosted Private Cloud](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/maintenance-rescheduling).

You can also filter operations by status via the dropdown menu above the table on the left.

### Access to details of maintenance operations

/// details | How to access to the details of maintenance operations?

#### Via the OVHcloud Control Panel

The OVHcloud Control Panel operation section has 11 sections.

Here is an example of an export of VMware Hosted Private Cloud Control Panel operations on OVHcloud:

| Reference | Name | Type | Progress | Comment | Affected services | Created by | Created By | Processing | End | Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|--|--|---|---|---|
| 44XXXXXX | provisionVcsaSolo | Generic | Completed | Infrastructure management provisions for customer | Task: 44XXXXXX | Information unavailable | Information unavailable | May XX, 2023 6:37:51 p.m. | XX May 2023 6:37:XX | XX May 2023 6:37:58 PM |

An operation referencing ID is always added on each operation, along with an assigned name, type, progress, comment, service, and processing dates.

Of course, for each OVHcloud service (Bare Metal Cloud, Public Cloud, etc.) these names and references may change.

#### Via the OVHcloud API

> [!success]
>
> Read the [Getting started with OVHcloud APIs](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps) guide to get familiar with using OVHcloud APIv6.

Run the following API call to get the list of operations:

> [!api]
> 
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud get /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/robot
>

> **Parameters:**
> 
> - `serviceName`: Your Dedicated Cloud reference in the form `pcc-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX`.
>

Return example (the return scheme may vary and be quite long depending on the size of your infrastructure):

``` shell
...
  "updateUser",
  maintenanceLinkAlreadyOrderedCertsToObjects,
  maintenanceFixTransportMode,
  maintenanceUpdateAntivirusConfiguration,
...
```

To get the details of each robot, run the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud get /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/robot/{name}
>

> **Parameters:**
> 
> - `serviceName`: Your Dedicated Cloud reference in the form `pcc-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX`.
> - `name`: The name of the robot, e.g. `maintenanceUpdateAntivirusConfiguration`.
>

**Return :**
``` shell
{
  "type": "task",
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "maintenanceUpdateAntivirusConfiguration",
  "criticity": "normal",
  "description": ""
}
```

## Glossary

**Control Plane Unavailable**: Indicates that the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) cannot be contacted. Therefore, not all products that need to reach VCSA will work.

This represents the following products/options in Hosted Private Cloud VMware on OVHcloud :

- **NSX-T** interface.
- **vROps** interface.
- Managed **Veeam** (no backup/restore operation).
- **Zerto** interface (continuous replication).
- **Tanzu** Kubernetes Grid.

Any other tier products that you can use that require **VCSA** will also be affected.

## Control plane explanations

The control plane is the part of the system responsible for managing and controlling resources in a virtualized environment. Specifically, the control plane is the software layer that manages operations and decisions related to the configuration, resource management, tracking, and orchestration of the virtual machines and associated infrastructure.

- **Resource management**: It supports the configuration and management of physical (servers, storage, networking) and virtual (virtual machines) resources.
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates operations between different infrastructure components, making it easy to deploy, migrate and manage virtual machines.
- **Monitoring**: Collects performance, health and resource usage data for real-time monitoring and reporting.
- **Security**: Manages security policies, including authentication, authorization, and access control, ensuring the security of virtualized resources.
- **Automation**: Supports the automation of repetitive tasks, allowing administrators to define automated workflows and policies.

In short, the control plane is the software layer that provides centralized management, coordination, and control.
