## Objective

Within your OVHcloud environment, you can add a new dedicated host in just a few minutes.

**Learn how to add compute capabilities to your infrastructure.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pt/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to vSphere (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))

## Instructions

> Adding resources through vSphere adds them as hourly resources for billing purposes. If you wish to switch them to monthly resources, it can be changed in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
