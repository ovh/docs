title: Configuring DNS Forwarder in NSX
excerpt: Discover how to add a DNS forwarder to NSX
updated: 2023-02-27

## Objective

You can use a DNS forwarder in NSX that centralises all DNS queries and redirects them to external DNS servers, which reduces network traffic. You can attach the DNS forwarder to the north-south gateway (ovh-T0-gw) or the east-west gateway (ovh-T1-gw), depending on your needs.

**Discover how to configure a DNS forwarder.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- You need to have **NSX** deployed with a segment configured in your NSX configuration. Use our guide on [segment management in NSX](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-02-segment-management) for more information.

## Instructions

We will create a DNS redirector and attach it to the north-south gateway (ovh-t0-gw), it will be usable on all segments of NSX.

### DNS forwarder configuration

Through the NSX interface go to the `Networking`{.action} tab and click on `DNS`{.action} on the left in the **IP Management** section. Then click `ADD DNS SERVICE`{.action}.

![Configure DNS forwarder 01](images/01-configure-dns-forwarder01.png){.thumbnail}

Enter this information :

- **Name** : Your service name, such as `dns-forwarder`.
- **Tier-0/Tier-1 Gateway** : Your North-South gateway `ovh-T0-gw`.
- **DNS Service IP** : a private IP address not used in your segments, such as `192.168.200.1`.

Next, click the `three vertical dots`{.action} below **Default DNS Zone**.

Click `Add New Default Zone`{.action}.

![Configure DNS forwarder 03](images/01-configure-dns-forwarder03.png){.thumbnail}

Fill in these values :

- **Name** : The name of the zone, such as `cdns.ovh.net`.
- **DNS Servers** : OVHcloud DNS server `213.186.33.99`.

Then click `SAVE`{.action}.

![Configure DNS forwarder 04](images/01-configure-dns-forwarder04.png){.thumbnail}

Click `SAVE`{.action}.

![Configure DNS forwarder 05](images/01-configure-dns-forwarder05.png){.thumbnail}

Your DNS forwarder is active and usable on all your overlay or VLAN segments connected to your north-south gateway (ovh-t0-gw).

### Editing the DHCP server to use a DNS forwarder

If you have configured DHCP servers in NSX as described in our [Configuring DHCP](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/nsx-03-configure-dhcp-onsegment) guide, you have the option to modify the configuration to use the DNS forwarder in your DHCP configurations.

We will see how to modify the DNS server on the DHCP configuration of one of your segments.

Still from the `Networking`{.action} tab, click `Segments`{.action} on the left in the **Connectivity** section. 

Then click on the `three vertical dots`{.action} next to your segment and choose `Edit`{.action} from the menu.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 01](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment01.png){.thumbnail}

Click `EDIT DHCP CONFIG`{.action}.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 02](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment02.png){.thumbnail}

Click the `X`{.action} to the right of the existing DNS in the **DNS Servers** option to remove it from the configuration.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 03](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment03.png){.thumbnail}

Add your DNS redirector IP address in **DNS Servers** as `192.168.200.1`{.action} and click `APPLY`{.action}.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 04](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment04.png){.thumbnail}

Click `SAVE`{.action}.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 05](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment05.png){.thumbnail}

Click `CLOSE EDITING`{.action}.

![Modify DHCP overlay segment 06](images/02-modify-dhcp-overlay-segment06.png){.thumbnail}

Your segment's DHCP settings now use the DNS forwarder you created earlier.
