## Objective

Use the vSphere monitoring tools to troubleshoot a slow VM.

**This guide offers a step by step study case to troubleshoot performance issues on a VM.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to vSphere (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))

## Instructions

You have three levels of monitoring accessible in vSphere to troubleshoot issues:

- VM
- Cluster
- Storage

### VM Monitoring

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Hosts and Clusters`{.action} dashboard.<br>
Navigate to your VM and select it.<br>
The `Monitor`{.action} tab presents performance `Overview`{.action}.<br>
You may see real-time metrics or choose to check a timeframe to see performance evolution.<br>
You may also change the view to dig on more specific subjects.

You may also use the `Utilization`{.action} section to help your investigations.

### Cluster monitoring

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Hosts and Clusters`{.action} dashboard.<br>
Navigate to your Cluster and select it.<br>
The `Monitor`{.action} tab presents performance `Overview`{.action}.<br>
You may see real-time metrics or choose to check a timeframe to see performance evolution.<br>
You may also change the view to dig on more specific subjects.

You may also use the `Resource Allocation`{.action} and `Utilization`{.action} sections to help your investigations.

### Storage monitoring

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Storage`{.action} dashboard.<br>
Navigate to your datastore and select it.<br>
The `Monitor`{.action} tab presents performance `Overview`{.action}.<br>
You may see real-time metrics or choose to check a timeframe to see performance evolution.<br>
You may also change the view to dig on more specific subjects.
