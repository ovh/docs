## Objective

Within your OVHcloud environment, you can add a new dedicated datastore in just a few minutes.

**Learn how to add storage to your infrastructure.**

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to vSphere (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager))

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> Adding resources through vSphere adds them as hourly resources for billing purposes. If you wish to switch them to monthly resources, it can be changed in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
> For more info on this, check out our [Introduction to the Hosted Private Cloud Control Panel](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/manager_ovh_private_cloud)
