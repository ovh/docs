## Objective

The purpose of this guide is to show you the usage of the KMIP protocol and the different operations and types supported by the OVHcloud KMS.

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud customer account](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/ovhcloud-account-creation).
- [An OVHcloud KMS ordered and an access certificate created](/pages/manage_and_operate/kms/quick-start)

## Instructions

### Description

[KMIP](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=kmip) (Key Management Interoperability Protocol) is a protocol designed to standardise the communications with a KMS.

So any producs supporting KMIP (such as VMware vSphere, Veeam, Nutanix, etc.) can natively be interfaced with a KMIP compatible KMS such as the OVHcloud KMS.

It brings an easy connection, and a reversible configuration.

### Connection of a KMIP compatible product with the OVHcloud KMS

The configuration depends on the product to integrate, but does not need any specific configuration on the OVHcloud KMS other than generating an access certificate.
Softwares editors usually offer dedicated guides for this purpose.

As an example, the following products were validated with the OVHcloud KMS : 

- [Nutanix](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide-v6_8:wc-security-data-encryption-setup-t.html)
- [VMware](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-security/GUID-9035D542-B76B-4244-966D-2A8D92ABF54C.html)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/tutorials/kmip/kmip-automatic/)
- [Barbican](https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/install/barbican-backend.html#kmip-plugin)
- [NetApp](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/configure-external-key-management-concept.html)

### Direct use

It's also possible to use the KMIP API directly.

Authentication on this procotol is done with a client certificate, in the same way as for the REST API. It needs to open a TLS channel with a valid access certificate.

Then it's possible to exchange KMIP messages such as defined in the standard. Depending n the technology stack, we recommend the following libraries:

- PyKMIP for python: <https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP>.
- Libkmip for C: <https://github.com/OpenKMIP/libkmip>.

### KMIP coverage

The OVHcloud KMS covers a part of 1.0 to 1.4 versions of the KMIP standard.
