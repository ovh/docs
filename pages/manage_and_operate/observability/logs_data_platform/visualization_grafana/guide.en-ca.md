title: Using Grafana with Logs Data Platform
updated: 2022-06-15
---

## Objective

[Grafana](http://grafana.org/){.external} provides a powerful and elegant way to create, explore, and share dashboards and data with your team and the world. Since release 7, Grafana is able to communicate with OpenSearch and so allow you to mix data from Logs Data Platform and other data sources like IoT at the same place. This guide will show you how to achieve this.

## Requirements

This is what you need to know to get you started:

- you are already sending logs on a stream you own [see the quick start tutorial](/pages/manage_and_operate/observability/logs_data_platform/getting_started_quick_start)
- Your have access to the port 9200 to your cluster (head to the **Home** page in manager to know the address of your cluster).

After some training you will be able to create this kind of dashboard:

## Instructions

### Select your Stream Alias

To access your logs from Grafana, you will need to setup an OpenSearch Alias and link them to your Graylog streams, so here we go again :

1. Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
2. In the Alias panel, click on the `Add an alias`{.action} button
3. Choose a name and define a description for your alias
4. Save the entry by clicking the `Save`{.action} button
5. Once the alias has been created. Use the **...** menu at the right and select `Attach content to the alias`{.action} option.
6. Define there the graylog streams you want to associate to your alias
7. That's it.

So here you go, now Logs Data Platform knows what stream you want to browse. Now letâ€™s configure Grafana and see if it works!

### Setup your own grafana

Get the latest Grafana release here: [http://grafana.org/download/](http://grafana.org/download/){.external} (v9.0.0 at the time of writing).
Then follow the Grafana installation guide according your platform: [http://docs.grafana.org/installation/](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/){.external}

### Launch it!

If everything is setup properly, launch your favorite browser, and point it to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){.external} Once logged in with your grafana credentials, reach data sources panel to setup your Logs Data Platform datasource:

> [!warning]
>
> To make the magic happen, please ensure to:
>
> - Set `https://<your_cluster>.logs.ovh.com:9200` as Url value
> - Set your Logs Data Platform credentials for Basic auth values
> - Set your Logs Data Platform alias name as Grafana Index name value
> - Change default Time field name to timestamp
> - Set **1.X** as OpenSearch version
> - Register your data source and test it.
>

If your configuration is correct, it should display: " _Index Ok. Timefield Ok._"

### Test it!

Now let's add a simple counter of your logs to a new dashboard.

1. On dashboard page, click on the green left button and select Add panel => Singlestat
2. On the bottom right, select your datasource.
3. That's it :)
