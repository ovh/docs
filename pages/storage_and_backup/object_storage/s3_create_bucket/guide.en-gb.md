## Instructions

### Using the Control Panel

You must link a user to the bucket:

To do this, you can either link an existing S3 user:

You can view the user credentials by clicking on `View credentials`{.action}:

Or you can create a new S3 user:

The user credentials are then displayed:

Name your bucket:

Finally, decide whether or not you wish to encrypt your data using [SSE-S3 (server-side encryption with OVHcloud Managed Keys)](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_encrypt_your_objects_with_sse_c).
