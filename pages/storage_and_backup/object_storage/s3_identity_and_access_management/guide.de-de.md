## Objective

The purpose of this guide is to show you how to manage your identities and access your S3 Object Storage resources.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

Log in to [the OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section, and select the Public Cloud project concerned. Then click on `Object Storage`{.action} in the left-hand menu.

### Creating a user

Click `Create User`{.action}.

If you already have OpenStack users, you can select one of these:

then

![Add S3 user](images/highperf-identity-and-access-management-2022092808554688.png)

> [!primary]
>
> If you choose to select an existing user, ensure that the user has an `ObjectStore operator` or `Administrator` role.
>

Otherwise, create a new user:

Once your user has been created, you will see the credentials:

> [!primary]
>
> By clicking on the `...`{.action} at the end of a user's line, you can, among other things, download the rclone configuration file, see the user's secret key, delete the user.
>

### Manage access to a bucket via a profile

You can define access to your buckets via predefined profiles.

Click on the `...`{.action} at the end of your bucket line, then `Add a user to a container`{.action}.

Set access to your bucket for this user and click on `Confirm`{.action}.

### Advanced resource access management

You can refine your permissions by importing a JSON configuration file. To do this, go to the `S3 Policy Users`{.action} tab.

Click on the `...`{.action} at the end of your user's line, then `Import JSON file`{.action}.

> If you want to change a user's rights, you may need to download the JSON configuration file in advance by selecting `Download JSON File`{.action}.

Some examples of JSON configuration files:

**Read/write access to a bucket and its objects**

```json
{
  "Statement":[{
    "Sid": "RWContainer",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action":["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts", "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads", "s3:AbortMultipartUpload", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
    "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::hp-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::hp-bucket/*"]
  }]
}
```

**Read-only access to a bucket and its objects**

```json
{
  "Statement":[{
    "Sid": "ROContainer",
    "Effect": "Allow",

    "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::hp-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::hp-bucket/*"]
  }]
}
```

**Allow all operations on all project resources**

  }]
}
```

**Read/write access to all objects in a specific folder (`/home/user2`) in a specific bucket (`companybucket`)**
