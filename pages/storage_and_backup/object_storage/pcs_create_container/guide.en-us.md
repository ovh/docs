## Objectif

The Object Storage solution for Public Cloud offers an unlimited storage solution with simple billing tailored to your needs. There are many types of object containers:

- For static hosting (static website).
- For private hosting (e.g. storage of personal data).
- For public hosting (to store everything that is accessible to the public).
- For cold storage (archiving).

The first step is to create a container that will hold your files.

**This guide explains how to create it from the OVHcloud Control Panel and from the Openstack Horizon interface.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

If you use Horizon :

- An [OpenStack user](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_delete_a_user){.external}
