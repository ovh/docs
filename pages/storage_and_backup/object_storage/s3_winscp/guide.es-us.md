## Objective

[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) is an open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client, S3 client, SCP client and file manager for Windows.

**This guide explains how to configure WinSCP to manage your buckets and objects.**

## Requirements

- A bucket
- A user with the required access rights on the bucket
- Your S3 credentials (`access_key` and `secret_access_key`)

See our [Getting started with S3 Object Storage](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_getting_started_with_object_storage) guide.

## Instructions

Start WinSCP. The login dialog will appear. Fill in the fields as follows:

1\. Make sure the `New Site` node is selected.
