## Objective

Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a file server connected to a network whose main function is the storing of data in a centralised volume for heterogeneous network clients.

## Requirements

- An IP address attached to an OVHcloud service (Hosted Private Cloud, Dedicated Server, VPS, Public Cloud instance, etc.)
- A [HA-NAS solution](https://www.ovh.com/world/nas/)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager){.external}

## Instructions

You can manage your HA-NAS via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager){.external}.

Once you have logged in, click on `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action}, then `NAS and CDN`{.action} in the menu on the left. Click on your service to access the administration menu.

### Creating a partition <a name="partition"></a>

To add a new partition, click `Create a partition`{.action}.

![create a partition](images/nas2021-02.png){.thumbnail}

Simply enter your partition **name**, partition **size**, and authorised **protocol** (NFS or CIFS).

### Modifying the size of a partition

To change the size of a partition, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the partition concerned, then `Modify size`{.action}.

Enter the new size, then confirm.

### Change the frequency of snapshots

By default, a snapshot of your NAS content takes place every hour, and is saved on your NAS.

However, you can create up to 3 additional snapshots at different frequencies if you wish, which will also be saved on your NAS.

To do this, click the `...`{.action} button to the right of the partition concerned, then click `Frequency of snapshots`{.action}.

Select the new frequency, then confirm.

### Creating an instant snapshot

Apart from the snapshots taken automatically, you can create an instant snapshot of a partition at any time by clicking on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the partition, then on `Custom snapshot`{.action}.

Name the snapshot and click `Add`{.action}.

### Adding an access <a name="addaccess"></a>

In order to access the partition you created earlier, you will need to configure access.

> [!primary]
>
> Only OVHcloud service IP addresses can access your NAS (e.g. a dedicated server, a VPS, a Public Cloud instance, etc.).
>

To authorise an IP to access the NAS, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the existing partition, then on `Manage access`{.action}.

Then click `Add an access`{.action}, and select the IP address of your OVHcloud product.
<br>You must also define whether the authorised access for this IP address is read-only or read/write.

#### Deleting an access

To remove access to a partition, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the IP address concerned, then `Delete`{.action}.

### ZFS settings

> [!warning]
>
> All the default Z File System settings are optimised. Though we do not recommend changing those settings, this menu does allow you to adjust the ZFS that the HA-NAS is using.
>

To change the ZFS settings of a partition, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the partition concerned, then `Z File System (ZFS) settings`{.action}.

- **Disabling access time update (atime)**: Disabling *atime* means the kernel will no longer update the file system timestamp each time a file is accessed. This can be useful to speed up frequent read operations, for example on static web pages. However, it should not be enabled for consistency-critical applications such as databases.
- **ZFS recordsize**: This property changes the maximum block size on the ZFS filesystem. Please note that ZFS will still use a smaller block size if the file is smaller than the maximum. For example, a 16 KB file will use a 16 KB block (plus metadata) to not waste storage space. We generally advise against changing ZFS *recordsize* for this reason.
- **Sync**: This changes the behaviour of ZFS filesystem transactions with regard to RAM data buffering and writing data to disk. We do not recommend changing this property without an appropriate reason.

### Deleting a partition

> [!alert]
>
> Deleting a partition deletes all of the data stored on it permanently.
>

To delete a partition, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the existing partition, then `Delete`{.action}.
