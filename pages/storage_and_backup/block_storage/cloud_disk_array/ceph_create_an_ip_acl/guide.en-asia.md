First, connect to the [Cloud Disk Array manager](/links/manager){.external}. Under 'Platforms and services' select your Ceph cluster. On the bottom right, you will find the existing ACL. By default there is no ACL.

Get your ip address.

```bash
admin@server:~$ ip -4 a
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 123.123.123.123/32 brd 234.234.234.234 scope global eth0
      valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Add your IP.

![Ceph pools](images/create_an_ip_acl_2.png){.thumbnail}

And create the IP ACL.

After the pool creation, you are back to manager. You can see that cluster status has changed because the ACL is being created.

## Using API

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph POST /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/acl
>
serviceName is the fsid of your cluster.

You can check ACL creation by listing ACL.

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph GET /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/acl
>
Example:

```bash
GET /dedicated/ceph/98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15/acl
[
  {
    network: "123.123.123.123"
    id: 57054
    netmask: "255.255.255.255"
    family: "IPV4"
  }
]
```
