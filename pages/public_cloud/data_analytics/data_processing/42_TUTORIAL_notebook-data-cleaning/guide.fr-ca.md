## Objective

The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to clean data with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) inside a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

*Data Cleaning* or *Data Cleansing* is the preparation of raw data by detecting and correcting records within a dataset.

This tutorial presents a simple data cleaning with `Notebooks for Apache Spark`.

## Requirements 

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr-ca/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

### Upload data

First, download these 2 dataset CSV files locally:
- [books.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/master/apache_spark_notebook_data_cleaning/books.csv)
- [ratings.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/master/apache_spark_notebook_data_cleaning/ratings.csv)

Then, from the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), go to the Object Storage section, locate your S3 bucket and upload your data by clicking `Add object`{.action}.

Select both files from your computer and add them to the root (`/`) of your bucket.

### Retrieve bucket credentials

> [!warning]
>
> Please be aware that notebooks are only available in `public access` during the `alpha` of the Notebooks for Apache Spark feature. As such, be careful of the **data** and the **credentials** you may expose in these notebooks.

There is some information that we will need as inputs of the notebook.

First, and while we're on the container page of the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) we will copy the `Endpoint` information and save it.

Go back to the Object Storage home page and then to the S3 users tab, copy the user's `access key` and save it.

Finally, click on the `...`{.action} button at the end of the user row, click on `View the secret key`{.action}, copy the value and save it.

### Launch and access a Notebook for Apache Spark

From the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), go to the Data Processing section and create a new notebook by clicking `Data Processing`{.action} and then `Create notebook`{.action}.

You can then reach the `JupyterLab` URL directly from the notebooks list or from the notebook page.

### Experiment with the notebook

Now that you have your initial datasets ready on an Object Storage and a notebook running, you can start cleaning this data.

A preview of this notebook can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/blob/master/apache_spark_notebook_data_cleaning/apache_spark_notebook_data_cleaning_tutorial.ipynb).

### Go further

- Do you want to create a data cleaning job you could replay based on your notebook? [Please refer to this guide](/pages/public_cloud/data_analytics/data_processing/31_HOWTO_submit-python-ui).
