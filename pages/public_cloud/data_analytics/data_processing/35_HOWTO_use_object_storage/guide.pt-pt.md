## Objective
This guide gives you some basic examples about using OpenStack Swift and its S3 API with OVHcloud Data Processing.

We will use both the OpenStack Swift native API and its S3 API in read/write mode.

Samples are based on the well-known WordCount. We will first read data from a text file, then count the frequence of each word in this particular file.

## Requirements
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
- An OVHcloud account
- A cloud project in your OVHcloud account (see [How to create a cloud project](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_a_public_cloud_project){.external} for details).
- Data Processing activated (see [How to activate the Data Processing service](/pages/public_cloud/data_analytics/data_processing/30_HOWTO_activate_project){.external} for details).
- A Conda compatible environment file.
The following is an example with only dependencies required for this How to: [environment.yml](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/environment.yml) [[1]](#notes).
Otherwise, this [How to](/pages/public_cloud/data_analytics/data_processing/34_HOWTO_handle-python-environment) explains how to generate an environment file.
- The input file 'wordcount.txt' used by the following samples is available [Here](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/wordcount.txt) [[1]](#notes).
The wordcount.txt file should be uploaded in the container you're using when submitting a job. Please refer to this documentation that explains how to create a Swift container [Getting started with the Swift API](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/pcs_getting_started_with_the_swift_api).

## Read data in the container specified when submitting your job using OpenStack Swift API

Find below the code in Python that:

- reads 'wordcount.txt' object in your OVHcloud Object Storage container
- prints the result in output log of the job

In this sample, the wordcount.txt should be uploaded to the same container as you uploaded the wordcount.py file. Then Data Processing will download all of the files in this container into the cluster and the wordcount.txt file would be accessible in the python code as a local file. 

Save it in a file called 'wordcount.py' or download it from this repository: [Data Processing Samples - Object Storage](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/wordcount.py) [[1]](#notes).

Here we use Apache Spark and the OpenStack Swift API.

```python
from __future__ import print_function
from operator import add
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # create a SparkSession
    spark = SparkSession\
        .builder\
        .appName("PythonWordCount")\
        .getOrCreate()

    # read the input file directly in the same Swift container that hosts the current script
    # create a rdd that contains lines of the input file
    lines = spark.read.text("wordcount.txt").rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])

    # split lines, extract words and count the number of occurrences for each of them
    counts = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \
                  .map(lambda x: (x, 1)) \
                  .reduceByKey(add)

    # print the result
    output = counts.collect()
    for (word, count) in output:
        print("%s: %i" % (word, count))

    # very important: stop the current session
    spark.stop()
```

## Read and write data with Apache Spark using OpenStack Swift S3 API

Find below the code in Python that:

- reads an object 'wordcount.txt' in an OVHcloud Object Storage container using its S3 API
- stores the number of occurrences per word in a S3 object
- prints the result in output log of the job

Save it in a file called 'wordcount_s3only.py' or download it from this repository: [Data Processing Samples - Object Storage](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/wordcount_s3only.py) [[1]](#notes).

Credentials provided for S3 can concern any OVHcloud Object Storage container. In this sample, you can upload the wordcount.txt file in any Object Storage container or account and it is not necessary that you upload it in the same container as the one that you upload the source code. Just you need to generate the proper access key and secret key for that container. (See [How to create EC2 credentials](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/pcs_getting_started_with_the_swift_s3_api){.external} for more details)

```python
from __future__ import print_function
from operator import add
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # create a SparkSession
    # We want to use the Swift S3 API. So we have to provide some attributes
    spark = SparkSession\
        .builder\
        .appName("PythonWordCount") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key", "7decf61921524a6b828c9305a77bb201") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key", "9e9c50f2ff514fc3bdc5f98e61bec81f") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem")\
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access", "true")\
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint", "s3.gra.cloud.ovh.net")\
        .getOrCreate()

    # read the input file in Swift through the S3 API
    # create a rdd that contains lines of the input file
    lines = spark.read.text("s3a://odp-s3/wordcount.txt").rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])

    # split lines, extract words and count the number of occurrences for each of them
    counts = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \
                  .map(lambda x: (x, 1)) \
                  .reduceByKey(add)

    # store the result in the same (or another) bucket but in the same project
    # according to the attributes provided in SparkSession
    counts.saveAsTextFile("s3a://odp-s3/wordcount_result.txt")

    # print the result
    output = counts.collect()
    for (word, count) in output:
        print("%s: %i" % (word, count))

    # very important: stop the current session
    spark.stop()
```

## Read data with Apache Spark using OpenStack Swift API and write the result using S3 implementation

Find below the code in Python that:

- reads an object 'wordcount.txt' through the native OpenStack Swift API
- stores the number of occurrences per word in Object Storage through its S3 API
- prints the result in the output log of the job

In this sample, the wordcount.txt should be uploaded to the same container as you uploaded the wordcount.py file. Then Data Processing will download all of the files in this container into the cluster and the wordcount.txt file would be accessible in the python code as a local file. 

Save it in a file called 'wordcount_both.py' or download it from this repository: [Data Processing Samples - Object Storage](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/wordcount_both.py) [[1]](#notes).

Credentials provided for S3 can concern any OVHcloud Object Storage container. 
In this sample you need to generate S3 access key and secret key for the destination container in which you would like to write the result. 
(See [How to create EC2 credentials](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/pcs_getting_started_with_the_swift_s3_api){.external} for more details)
Thus, you can read data from your Swift container and write the result in another container.

```python
from __future__ import print_function
from operator import add
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # create a SparkSession
    # we want to use the Swift S3 API. So we have to provide some attributes
    spark = SparkSession \
        .builder \
        .appName("PythonWordCount") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key", "7decf61921524a6b828c9305a77bb201") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key", "9e9c50f2ff514fc3bdc5f98e61bec81f") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access", "true") \
        .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint", "s3.gra.cloud.ovh.net") \
        .getOrCreate()

    # read the input file directly in the same Swift container that hosts the current script
    # create a rdd that contains lines of the input file
    lines = spark.read.text("wordcount.txt").rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])

    # split lines, extract words and count the number of occurrences for each of them
    counts = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \
                  .map(lambda x: (x, 1)) \
                  .reduceByKey(add)

    # store the result in the same (or another) container according to the attributes provided in SparkSession
    # here we use the S3 API
    counts.saveAsTextFile("s3a://odp-s3/wordcount_result.txt")

    # print the result
    output = counts.collect()
    for (word, count) in output:
        print("%s: %i" % (word, count))

    # very important: stop the current session
    spark.stop()
```

## Read data with boto3 API

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.
[Boto3 - the AWS SDK for Python](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/) 

Find below the code in Python that stores a basic string in S3 object.

Save it in a file called 'boto3_sample.py' or download it from this repository: [Data Processing Samples - Object Storage](https://github.com/ovh/data-processing-samples/tree/master/python_objectStorage/boto3_sample.py) [[1]](#notes).

Credentials provided for S3 can concern any OVHcloud Object Storage container.

Here we don't use Spark but sometimes depending on your use cases you may have to interact with S3 outside the Apache Spark framework.

```python
import boto3
import io

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # here we use boto3 to access the container through the Swift S3 API
    # so we have to define some attributes to provide an access to the swift container
    s3 = boto3.client('s3',
                      aws_access_key_id="7decf61921524a6b828c9305a77bb201",
                      aws_secret_access_key="9e9c50f2ff514fc3bdc5f98e61bec81f",
                      endpoint_url="https://s3.gra.cloud.ovh.net/",
                      region_name="gra")

    bytes_to_write = b"This a string to be written in a file."

    file = io.BytesIO(bytes_to_write)

    # write string through the S3 API with boto3
    s3.upload_fileobj(file, "odp-s3", "test_write_string.txt")
```

## Go further

These samples are quite basic. They provide the first step to interact with Object Storage from within your code and, then, go further.
