title: Attaching a Floating IP to a Public Cloud instance (EN)
excerpt: Find out how a Floating IP address functions and how to configure it
updated: 2024-03-26
---

## Objective

Floating IPs are public IP addresses for [Public Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pl/public-cloud/), used to expose a private instance or a private network service to the public network. You can read more about it on our dedicated [concepts page](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/concepts-02-additional-ip-vs-floating-ip).

**This guide explains how to attach Floating IP addresses to your instances.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pl/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud API](https://eu.api.ovh.com/), the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) or the OpenStack command line environment ([Tutorial](/pages/public_cloud/compute/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api))
- The [OpenStack Command Line Interface](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html){.external} tool installed on your working environment (optional)

## Understanding the Floating IP service

Floating IP is one of the services delivered by the OpenStack DVR (Distributed Virtual Router) services of the OVHcloud Public Cloud.

Floating IP allows you to create a public IP address and use it for your private network based VMs for incoming and outgoing traffic. Floating IP addresses can be attached and detached from your VMs at any time. 

You can hold Floating IP addresses without attaching them to any service. They remain available for your resources until they are manually deleted.

### Target configuration architecture

![diagram](images/architecture.png){.thumbnail}

The goal of this exercise is to create a VM (**vm4fip**) with a private local network (**test-network**) only, and use a router (**router1**) to set up a Floating IP.

Next, we will use this Floating IP to connect to the instance (VM) from the outside and check its access to the Internet.

## Instructions

### Via the OVHcloud Control Panel

#### Attaching a Floating IP to an instance

> [!success]
> Click one of the two tabs below depending on whether you want to attach a Floating IP to a new instance (**Option 1**) or an existing instance (**Option 2**).

> [!tabs]
> **Option 1**
>> 
>> **In case of a new instance**
>>
>> If you wish to attach a Floating IP to an existing instance, please skip to **Option 2** (second tab above).
>>
>> Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and select the Public Cloud project concerned.
>> 
>> Before creating your instance, make sure you have created a [private network with Gateway](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-02-create-private-network-gateway).
>>
>> To create a new instance, follow [this guide](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps) if necessary. 
>>
>>
>> > [!warning]
>> > As of today, all regions do not support this feature. Make sure to create an instance in a valid region. For more information, please refer to our [regions availability](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pl/public-cloud/regions-availability/) page. 
>> > 
>>
>> In Step 5, you have the option to choose a mode for your instance: Public mode or Private mode to be used for your instance networking. 
>>
>> By default, the public mode is selected, but since we are creating an instance to which we will attach a Floating IP, we need to create an instance with a private network **ONLY**.
>>
>> Select the `Private mode`{.action} and click on the drop down list to select a private network of your choice (the network must have been previously created with a Gateway or linked to a Gateway). 
>>
>> If you select a private network that is not linked to a Gateway, the system will automatically create a Gateway of size "S" by default and attach it to your network.
>> 
>> ![Private Network](images/privatemode.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> In the next step, check the box next to `Attach a Floating IP to this Instance`{.action}, and select `Create a new Floating IP`{.action}.
>>
>> ![attachandcreatefip](images/createfloatingip.png){.thumbnail}
>> 
>> When you have applied your choices, click `Next`{.action} to proceed to the final step and decide on a billing method.
>>
>> ![selectbilling](images/selectbilling.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> We recommend to choose hourly billing if there is any doubt regarding the usage period, because it is not possible to choose it after the service delivery. You will have the option to switch to a monthly subscription as soon as the instance is available on the “Instances” page.
>>
>> > [!warning]
>> > If you choose to be billed hourly, you will continue to be billed as long as the instance is not deleted. It does not matter if the instance is not actually used during this time. 
>> >
>>
>> Once you have made sure that your configuration choices are correct, click on the `Create an instance`{.action} button to finish creating your new instance. It may take a few minutes until your service is delivered.
>> 
>>
> **Option 2** 
>>
>> **In case of an existing instance (created with a private network only).**
>>
>> Please note that the private network must be linked to a gateway. For more information, consult this guide: [Creating a private network with Gateway](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-02-create-private-network-gateway).
>>
>> In the public cloud section, click on `Public IPs`{.action} in the left-hand menu under **Network**.
>>
>> Click on `Floating IPs`{.action}, then on `Add a new IP`{.action}.
>>
>> ![add a new ip](images/addfloatingip.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> Underneath "Select your public use", select the `Floating IPs (Public Cloud)`{.action}.
>> 
>> ![select floating ip](images/selectfip.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> In the next step, choose a region for your Floating IPs. The region must be the same as that of the instance you wish to attach the Floating IP to.
>>
>> ![select location ip](images/selectregionip.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > Please note that only regions in which this service is available will be displayed.
>> >
>>
>> Next, click on the drop down list to select the instance to attach the Floating IP to, then select the network/IP (this will be in the default range selected when creating the private network of the instance). 
>>
>> ![select instance](images/selectinstance.png){.thumbnail}
>> 
>> > [!primary]
>> > In case your instance is attached to two or more private networks, you will be presented with an equal amount of private IPs to select from, select the private IP of your choice.
>> > 
>> 
>> Once done, click on `Generate purchase order`{.action}. It may take a few minutes until your service is delivered.
>>
>> ![generate order](images/createfiporder.png){.thumbnail}

#### Detaching a Floating IP

This feature is currently only available via the [OpenStack API](#detachip). 

#### Deleting a Floating IP

In the public cloud section, click on `Public IPs`{.action} in the left-hand menu under **Network**.

In the `Floating IP`{.action} tab, click on the `...`{.action} next to the corresponding IP and select `Delete`{.action}.

![delete floating ip](images/deletefip.png){.thumbnail}

In the pop-up window, proceed with the deletion of the IP by clicking on `Confirm`{.action}.

#### Adding a DNS to a Floating IP

> [!primary]
> This procedure must be carried out **after** you have followed the 9 steps above.

To add a DNS to a Floating IP, run the following command from the command line.

```bash
$ openstack floating ip set --dns-domain <DOMAIN_NAME> <IP_ADDRESS_ID>
```

#### Detaching a Floating IP <a name="detachip"></a>

You can detach a Floating ip from your VM at anytime.

```bash
$ openstack server remove floating ip vm4fip 169.254.10.25
$ openstack floating ip list

#### Deleting a Floating IP

To delete a Floating IP, you must do it explicitly:

```bash
$ openstack floating ip delete 169.254.10.25
$ openstack floating ip list
```

### Via the OVHcloud API

#### Attaching a Floating IP to an instance

With the OVHcloud API, you can only attach a Floating IP to an existing instance.
