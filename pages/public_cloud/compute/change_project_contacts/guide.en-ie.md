## Objective

You can change the contacts for project administration and billing of a Public Cloud project in the OVHcloud Control Panel.<br>
Modifying these contacts enables you to separate the technical management of services within a project from the project's billing.

**This guide explains how to change the contacts of a Public Cloud project in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie)
- Admin and billing contacts in the same OVHcloud subsidiary

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie) and open your `Public Cloud`{.action} project. Click on `Contacts and Rights`{.action} in the **Project Management** section.

On this page you can see the administrative and billing contacts associated with your project.

In the new window, enter the desired NIC handle for each contact you wish to change. Bear in mind that the OVHcloud accounts for `Admin` and `Billing` contacts have to be registered in the same OVHcloud subsidiary.

Once you have clicked `Confirm`{.action}, both OVHcloud accounts affected by the change will receive a confirmation email. This email contains a token with which the contact change can be accepted in the tab `My requests`{.action} of the **Contact management** section.
