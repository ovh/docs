## Objective

You can attach additional disks to your Public Cloud instances based on previously created volume snapshots.

This may be useful in the following cases:

- If you want to restore additional disk data.
- If you want to have a highly available, high-performance storage space with your data.
- If you want to move your data to another instance.

**This guide explains how to create and configure an additional disk on one of your instances from an additional disk backup.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca)
- A [Public Cloud instance](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/public-cloud/){.external} in your OVHcloud account
- A volume snapshot in the same OpenStack region
- Administrative access (sudo) to your instance via SSH or RDP

## Instructions

### Creating the disk from a backup

Log in to [the OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca) and open your `Public Cloud`{.action} project. Then click `Volume Snapshot`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar under `Storage`.

To the right of the backup you want to create a volume from, click the `...`{.action} button, then `Create a volume`{.action}.

Then enter the name and capacity of the new disk, and click `Create the volume`{.action}.

![create volume](images/volume02.png){.thumbnail}

It may take a few minutes to create the disk, depending on its size.

### Attaching the disk to an instance

Once the disk has been created, you can choose to attach it to an instance. To do this, click `Block Storage`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar under `Storage`.

To the right of the volume of your choice, click on the `...`{.action} button, then `Attach to instance`{.action}.

Now select the instance and click `Confirm`{.action} to attach the disk.

The process of attaching the disk to your instance will then begin, and this may take a few minutes.

> [!warning]
Make sure to not leave the current page in your OVHcloud Control Panel while the disk is being attached. This may interrupt the process.

Once the attachment is complete, you can follow these steps on how to configure the additional disk [using Linux](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_configure_an_additional_disk_on_an_instance#using-linux) or [using Windows](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_configure_an_additional_disk_on_an_instance#using-windows).
