## Requirements

- [An instance created via the OVHcloud Control Panel](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps#step-3-creating-an-instance)
- [Root access to the instance](/pages/public_cloud/compute/become_root_and_change_password)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install Plesk.

Plesk can be installed easily via an SSH connection. To do this, download and launch the Plesk installation script using the command that best suits your situation below.

- **For a default, non-custom Plesk installation**:

```bash
# sh <(curl https://autoinstall.plesk.com/one-click-installer || wget -O - https://autoinstall.plesk.com/one-click-installer)
```

- **For a custom Plesk installation**:

```bash
# sh <(curl https://autoinstall.plesk.com/plesk-installer || wget -O - https://autoinstall.plesk.com/plesk-installer)
```

Then wait for the installation process to complete. 

### Step 2: Configure Plesk.

You can now log in to the Plesk interface and configure it. To do this, use the address `https://instance.IP.address:8443` in your web browser, replacing ‘instance.IP.address’ with your own instance’s IP address. You will then be asked to enter your **root** credentials.

Once you have logged in, a configuration wizard will appear. Here, you can configure the type of view that the Plesk interface will have. Pick a view type that suits your activity.

Select the Plesk interface view type you want to apply.

You will then need to enter information regarding access to your instance:

- the host name
- the IP address
- the root password

Enter this information in the specified fields.

Finally, you will need to fill in the **administrator** account information.

### Step 3: Add a licence.

To add your Plesk licence, take the key that was sent to you by your service provider.

When you first log in to the interface, you will see a page that offers to set up your Plesk licence.

Want to change your licence, to replace a test key or change your solution, for example? From the Plesk interface, go to the `Server Management` section and click `Tools & Settings`{.action}. Then go to the **Plesk** section, and select `License Management`{.action}.

Once you have added the new key, you can view the type of licence installed at the top of the menu bar, on the left.
