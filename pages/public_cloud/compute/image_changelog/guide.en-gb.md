title: 'Public Cloud & VPS - Image changelog'
excerpt: Find out what has changed in the images provided for Public Cloud & VPS

## Objective

OVHcloud offers a variety of operating systems and pre-installed applications on the VPS and Public Cloud products. As a provider, we ensure the images we provide to our customers are kept up to date which means we regularly release new images. Transparency is key to OVHcloud and we intend to share what changes we make to any image during any new release. This page will allow customers to track the changelog of our images.

## Requirements

This documentation will only apply to [VPS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/vps/compare/) and [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/compute/).

## 2021 Changelog

This section will display changelogs for each month in the year 2021.

### June

```
--- 01 June 2021 ---
Image: All
Product: Public Cloud / VPS
Task: <https://bare-metal-servers.status-ovhcloud.com/incidents/920sf4j7d8lq>
Changelog:
1. Adding new image: Fedora 34
2. Adding new image: Ubuntu 21.04
3. New image property "distro_family" added to each image to help group images into distributions.
4. New image property "hypervisor_type" added to each image which will be used by Nova to filter suitable hosts. This is to prevent spawning images made for QEMU to be spawned on Ironic hosts as they are not compatible.
5. Patch issue with Centos 7 - Plesk and Debian 10 - Plesk image with Lets Encrypt SSL. Plesk will now generate unique hostname for each installation unless there is a valid hostname detected on first boot.
6. General system updates applied to all images.

```

### February

```
--- 03 February 2021 ---
Image: All
Product: Public Cloud / VPS
Task: <https://bare-metal-servers.status-ovhcloud.com/incidents/58k8v7rm4crk>
Changelog:
1. All images contain new package / security updates from vendors since our last image updates
2. Centos 7 - cPanel image: we disabled QEMU Guest Agent on this image due to issues caused by creation of a virtfs when allowing Jailed Shell access. This virtfs cannot be frozen by QEMU Guest Agent and therefore causes a kernel panic. Customers with previous release of this image should check [this guide for fix](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/cpanel_snapshot)
