## Objective

The Horizon interface, natively offered with OpenStack, has been adapted by OVHcloud to offer additional features than those available in the OVHcloud Control Panel.

**Discover the main sections of the Horizon interface.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_a_public_cloud_project) in your OVHcloud account
- **[Optional since September 2023]** An [OpenStack user](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_delete_a_user) created in your project. This step is optional because we have deployed Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication between the OVHcloud Control Panel and Horizon.

## Instructions

### Logging in to OpenStack Horizon

- To log in with OVHcloud Single Sign-On: use the `Horizon`{.action} link in the left-hand menu under "Management Interfaces" after opening your `Public Cloud`{.action} project in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie).

- To log in with a specific OpenStack user: open the [Horizon login page](https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/auth/login/) and enter the [OpenStack user credentials](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_delete_a_user) previously created, then click on `Connect`{.action}.

### Data centre region selection

Unlike the OVHcloud Control Panel, Horizon separates your services according to their region. You can choose the region from the menu in the top left-hand corner:

##### **Overview**

- **Quota Summary**

Horizon provides a summary of quotas, which allows you to see the used and available resources for your projects:

- **Usage Summary**

Next is a summary of the use of your project instances. The search period can be customized to restrict this summary to a desired period.

- **Usage**

A summary of your usage is also available. This is a summary of the various services associated with the project, such as the list of instances.

The summary is downloadable in CSV format, which allows you to extract the information so that you can analyse it via other tools. Simply click on `Download CSV Summary`{.action}.
