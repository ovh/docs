## Objective

With the cloud-init module, you can configure your [Public Cloud instance](https://www.ovh.com/asia/public-cloud/instances/){.external} when you create it, and each time you reboot it. If you wish to reconfigure your hostname in order to fix an error creating your instance, or reconfigure your email server, you will need to disable the cloud-init module. This will configure the hostname so that it is not re-established.

**This guide will show you how to reconfigure cloud-init so that you can modify your instanceâ€™s hostname.**

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud Public Cloud instance](https://www.ovh.com/asia/public-cloud/instances/){.external}
- [SSH access](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps#step-4-connecting-to-your-instance) (sudo) to the instance

## Instructions

### Disable the cloud-init module.

To disable cloud-init, you will need to start by modifying the configuration file:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
```

Simply add the following two lines, or modify them if they already exist:

```sh
preserve_hostname: true
manage_etc_hosts: false
```

### Modify the hostname.

The first step involves modifying the hostname:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/hostname
webserver
```

Next, you will need to modify the `/etc/hosts` file:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/hosts

127.0.1.1 webserver.localdomain webserver
127.0.0.1 localhost
```

You will then need to reboot the instance:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After you reboot it, the hostname modifications will be properly applied:

```sh
sudo cat /etc/hosts

127.0.1.1 webserver.localdomain webserver
127.0.0.1 localhost
```
