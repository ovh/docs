## What is a rate limit?

A rate limit is a restriction enforced by the API on the number of requests a client can make to the API within a specified period.

## Why do we have rate limits?

Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for various reasons:

- They help us protect the API backend against abuse or misuse of the API.
- They ensure better quality of service on the API by having fair access to the API.

For example, a faulty or not well optimised script could try to overuse the API, which could cause performance issues on the API backend. 
By setting rate limits, we ensure that the API can maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all customers.

## What are the rate limits for our API?

### Keystone (OpenStack identity API)

We enforce rate limits at the OpenStack **User** level.

A user can do **60 requests per minute** before receiving an HTTP 429 response.

### Nova (OpenStack compute API)

We enforce rate limits at the OpenStack **Project** level.

A project can do **20 requests per second** before receiving an HTTP 429 response.

### Neutron (OpenStack network API)

We enforce rate limits at the OpenStack **Project** level.

A project can do **20 requests per second** before receiving an HTTP 429 response.

### Glance (OpenStack image API)

We enforce rate limits at the OpenStack **Project** level.

A project can do **20 requests per second** before receiving an HTTP 429 response.

### Cinder (OpenStack compute API)

We enforce rate limits at the OpenStack **Project** level.

A project can do **20 requests per second** before receiving an HTTP 429 response.

## How do rate limits work?

If you request too many tokens from Keystone (the identity API) or send too many requests to an API endpoint such as Nova (the compute API), the endpoint will start answering with an **HTTP 429** response code containing a JSON object like this one:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "status": "429 Too Many Requests",
        "message": "Too Many Requests"
    }
}
```

## How to ensure you don't make too many requests?

You should consider reducing the number of API calls your automation is doing below the rate limit of the endpoint.

Usually, you may end-up in such a situation when doing multiple requests in parallel (using multiple processes or threads).

There are various ways to improve the efficiency of your automation such as the use of caching and retry backoff mechanisms.

### Using cache

One of the option to reduce the number of call is to use cache.

For example, a keystone token is valid for 24 hours after it is issued. You could request only one token and keep it in a cache and re-use it for the whole day!

### Implementing retry backoff

If you really need to get regular information from the API, you can implement an automatic retry for requests with a random exponential backoff.

Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request.<br>
If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated.<br>
This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.

This approach has many benefits:

- Automatic retries mean you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data.
- Exponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail.
- Adding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time.

Note that unsuccessful requests do not contribute to your rate limit, so continuously resending a request could work but we may change this behavior in the future. We recommend not to rely on this mechanism.

Some examples of well-known libraries to implement retry backoff in Python are:

- Backoff: <https://pypi.org/project/backoff/>
