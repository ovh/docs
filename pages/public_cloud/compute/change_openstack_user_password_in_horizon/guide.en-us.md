## Objective

In our guide to [Configuring user access to Horizon](/pages/public_cloud/compute/introducing_horizon){.external}, we explained how to create and delete OpenStack users, as well as how to generate an access password.

Using the Horizon panel, you can also set passwords for each individual user. Please note that when you change a user password, the previous password will be immediately cancelled.

**This guide explains how to set custom user passwords in the Horizon interface.**

## Requirements

- You need to have created an OpenStack Horizon user account.

## Instructions

You can create an OpenStack password once you have logged in to your [OpenStack Horizon](https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net){.external} interface:
