title: Shelve or pause an instance
updated: 2023-06-20

## Objective

As part of the configuration of a high-availability infrastructure, you may encounter the need to cut access to your instances in order to perform different tests. OpenStack allows you to suspend, pause or shelve your instance. In each case, your IP is maintained.

> [!warning]
> The naming of these options in the OVHcloud Control Panel is different from the naming in Openstack/Horizon. If you are doing this via the OVHcloud Control Panel, make sure you select the right option.
>

**This guide explains how to shelve, pause or suspend your instance.**

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud Public Cloud instance](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps#step-3-creating-an-instance) on **hourly** billing
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie){.external} or [Horizon interface](/pages/public_cloud/compute/introducing_horizon)
- Knowledge of [Openstack API](/pages/public_cloud/compute/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api) and [Openstack variables](/pages/public_cloud/compute/loading_openstack_environment_variables)

## Instructions

> [!alert]
>
> These manipulations still result in the instance being billed as long as the instance is not deleted.
>

The table below allows you to differentiate the options available on your instances. Continue reading this guide by clicking on the option of your choice.

|Term|Description|Billing|
|---|---|---|
|[Shelve](#shelve-instance)|Retains the resources and data in your disk by creating a snapshot, all other resources are released.|You are only billed for the snapshot.|
|[Suspend](#stop-suspend-instance)|Stores the VM state on disk, the resources dedicated to instance are still reserved.|You will still be billed the same price for your instance.|
|[Pause](#pause-instance)|Stores the state of the VM in RAM, a paused instance becomes frozen.|You will still be billed the same price for your instance.|

### Shelve (suspend) an instance <a name="shelve-instance"></a>

> [!alert]
> Please note that suspending an IOPS or T1/T2-180 instance will result in the loss of data on the NVMe passthrough drives.
>
> Suspending this type of instance leads to its decommissioning from the host, and therefore from the disks in passthrough.
>

This option will allow you to release the resources dedicated to your Public Cloud instance, but the IP address will remain. The data on your local disk will be stored in a snapshot automatically created once the instance is shelved. Data stored in the memory and elsewhere will not be retained.

#### From the OVHcloud Control Panel

In the OVHcloud Control Panel, select your project from the `Public Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Instances`{.action} in the left side menu.

Click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the instance you want to suspend, then click on `Suspend`{.action}.

![suspend instance](images/suspend_an_instance.png){.thumbnail}

In the pop-up window, take note of the message and click on `Confirm`{.action}.

![confirm suspension](images/confirm_suspension.png){.thumbnail}

Once the process is completed, your instance will now appear as *Suspended*.

![suspended status](images/instance_suspended.png){.thumbnail}

To view the snapshot, click on `Instance Backup`{.action} underneath the `Storage` tab in the left side menu. A snapshot named *xxxxx-shelved* will now be visible:

![snapshot tab](images/shelved_backup.png){.thumbnail}

#### From the Horizon Interface

To proceed, you need to [configure user access to Horizon](/pages/public_cloud/compute/introducing_horizon) and [log in to the Horizon interface](https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/auth/login/).

If you have deployed instances in different regions, make sure you are in the correct region. You can verify this on the top left corner in the Horizon interface.

![horizon interface](images/firstaccesshorizon.png){.thumbnail}

Click on the `Compute`{.action} menu on the left side and select `Instances`{.action}. Select `Shelve Instance`{.action} in the drop list for the corresponding instance.

![shelve instance](images/shelveinstancehorizon.png){.thumbnail}

Once the process is completed, your instance will now appear as *Shelved Offloaded*.

![shelved instance](images/newinstancestatushorizon.png){.thumbnail}

To view the snapshot, in the `Compute`{.action} menu, click on `Images`{.action}.

![snapshot](images/snapshothorizon.png){.thumbnail}

#### Using Openstack/Nova APIs

Before proceeding, it is recommended that you consult these guides:

- [Prepare the environment to use the OpenStack API](/pages/public_cloud/compute/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api)
- [Set OpenStack environment variables](/pages/public_cloud/compute/loading_openstack_environment_variables)

Once your environment is ready, type the following at the command line:

```bash
openstack server shelve <UUID server>
 
=====================================

nova shelve <UUID server> 
```

### Unshelve (reactivate) an instance

This option will allow you to re-up your instance so that you can continue using it. Please note that once this is done, the regular billing will resume.

> [!alert] **Actions on the snapshot**
>
> Any actions on the snapshot other than *unshelve* can be very dangerous for your infrastructure in case of misuse. Once you *unshelve* an instance, the snapshot is automatically deleted. It is not recommended to deploy a new instance from any snapshot created as a result of shelving (suspending) an instance.

> OVHcloud is providing you with machines that you are responsible for. We have no access to these machines, and therefore cannot manage them.  You are responsible for your own software and security management. If you experience any issues or doubts when it comes to managing, using or securing your server, we recommend that you contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/directory/).
