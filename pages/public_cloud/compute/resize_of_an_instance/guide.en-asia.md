## Objective

As a result of increased activity, or simply new needs, your instance may not be able to meet this new burden due to a lack of resources. However, with the Public Cloud, you can increase the resources available to your instance, and this can be done with just a few clicks.

**This guide will show you how to resize your instance using the OpenStack Horizon interface.**

> [!warning]
>
> Only upscaling is possible for classic models.
> In addition, this manipulation causes the instance to be shut down for the time of the operation.
>

> [!warning]
>
> Metal instances can only be resized to and from other Metal flavors.
>

> [!success]
>
> Flex instances allow resizing to higher or lower models due to a locked single disk size.

Once the configuration is complete, click on `Resize`{.action}.

### Resizing a disk in Windows

When performing a resize for a Windows Instance, please note that the partition size is not automatically updated, so you will have to extend it using the **disk manager**:

- Right-click on the `Start`{.action} menu and launch the disk manager by clicking on `Disk Management`{.action}:
