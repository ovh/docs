## FAQ

### What happens to my monthly billing for my instances?

Billing for your monthly instances is now grouped under a single invoice, with your instances billed by the hour. The principle is as follows: the monthly subscription for an instance in a given month will appear on the invoice issued on the 1st of the following month.

### When do I owe an instance payment with monthly billing?

Any instance declared as monthly and existing on the 1st of the current month will be billed for a full month. It will then appear on the next bill on the first day of the following month, along with your other Public Cloud usage.

### If I start a monthly instance in the middle of the month, how do I pay?

This instance will be billed on a pro rata basis, based on the monthly price and the number of days remaining. For example, if you order a B2-7 monthly instance on the 13th of the month, the monthly price of which is $ 24.20 (incl. VAT), the instance will appear on the next bill on the first day of the following month. The pro rata price would be calculated as follows: 31-12 days consumed out of the 31 available in the month, i.e. ((31-12)/31) x 24.20 = $ 14,83 incl. VAT.

Then, if your instance still exists at the beginning of the month, you will return to the normal billing process: the monthly subscription for an instance in a given month will appear on the bill issued on the 1st of the following month. For example, if you ordered an instance in May and it is still active at the beginning of June, you would be billed on 1 July for the entire month of June.

### How do I ensure that I am no longer being billed for a monthly instance?

You will need to delete this instance before 00:00 on the 1st day of the following month, so that your monthly subscription is not renewed for this instance. 

### If I stop a monthly instance in the middle of the month, how do I pay?

If, for example, you have a C2-15 monthly instance and you delete it on the 27th day of the current month, you will be billed on the first day of the following month, once the entire current month has elapsed.

With a monthly commitment, any month you start is payable in full. But this instance will not generate any invoices in the following months.
