excerpt: Find out how to back up your Public Cloud Databases MongoDB cluster and restore it to a Discovery cluster using the CLI

## Objective

Public Cloud Databases allow you to focus on building and deploying cloud applications while OVHcloud takes care of the database infrastructure and maintenance in operational conditions. 

Several plans for MongoDB existed (Essential, Business, Enterprise) and recent updates changed it to Discovery, Production and Advanced.
This update means your cluster needs to be migrated from one of the deprecated plans to a new one.<br>
In most of the cases, this migration is automatic.
Nevertheless, if you want to migrate to a new Discovery cluster from a deprecated Essential or Business cluster, you will need to do it manually.

**This guide explains how to manually migrate data from an Essential or a Business cluster to a Discovery cluster for a MongoDb Public Cloud Database.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- A MongoDB database running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases service ([this guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_01_order_control_panel) can help you to meet this requirement)
- [Configure your MongoDB instance](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_02_manage_control_panel) to accept incoming connections

## Concept

The Public Cloud Databases MongoDB Discovery plan is intended for testing purposes.
The migration of a cluster using a deprecated plan is not automatic.
If you want to perform such a migration (e.g. from an `essential` cluster to a `discovery` one), you first need to create a new Discovery cluster, then migrate data from your deprecated cluster with the CLI.
For that purpose, you will need to backup your deprecated cluster data then restore it into the new Discovery cluster.

> [!warning]
>
> Because the disk space is low on a MongoDB Discovery plan, your deprecated MongoDB should not contain more data than the new MongoDB Discovery can handle.

## Instructions

### Ensure you can connect to your database

Follow the [MongoDB - Connect with CLI](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_03_connect_cli) guide in order to ensure you can connect to your database. That step ensures IP filtering is set up properly and that you have a suitable service URI available.

### Install the MongoDB Database Tools

Follow the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/) to install the MongoDB Database Tools for your platform. You will need the `mongodump` and `mongorestore` binaries in order to follow the rest of this procedure.

### Perform a backup of your deprecated cluster data

Back up your database to a file using:

```bash
$ mongodump --gzip --archive=path/to/backup.gz --readPreference=secondaryPreferred \
  --uri="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@mongodb-<deprecated-cluster-id>.database.cloud.ovh.net/admin?replicaSet=replicaset"
```

The MongoDB user needs to have sufficient privileges to perform the backup operation. This can be ensured by giving this user the `backup` role.

This operation might take some time, from a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the amount of data your database holds and your network connection. Once it completes, the file `path/to/backup.gz` will hold a backup of your data.

### Restore your data from the previous backup into the new Discovery cluster

> [!warning]
>
> This operation might clobber existing data in your database with the data from the backup you restore. Make sure this is what you actually want!
>

> [!primary]
>
> The `mongorestore`command  merges data.
>
> After the restore operation, any data that was stored in your database which isn't also part of the backup file (e.g. other collections or other keys) will be left untouched. That is to say, `mongorestore` merges data from your backup file with preexisting data in the database.
>

Restore your database from a backup using:

```bash
$ mongorestore --gzip --archive=path/to/backup.gz \
  --uri="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@mongodb-<discovery-cluster-id>.database.cloud.ovh.net/admin?replicaSet=replicaset"
```

The MongoDB user needs to have sufficient privileges to perform the restore operation. This can be ensured by giving this user the `restore` role.

Again, depending on the volume of data and your network connection, this operation might take some time. Once it completes, any data contained in your backup file will be present in your database.
