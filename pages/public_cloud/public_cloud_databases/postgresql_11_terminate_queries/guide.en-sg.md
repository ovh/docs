## Objective

Queries on a PostgreSQL instance can run indefinitely, and OVHcloud will not stop them automatically. Such queries can lock resources inappropriatly and cause wrong behaviors in your system.

**This guide explains how to detect and terminate specific sessions via the OVHcloud Control Panel and Command Line Interface (CLI).**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- A PostgreSQL database running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases ([this guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_01_order_control_panel) can help you to meet this requirement)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

### Terminate long-running queries with OVHcloud Control Panel

From your OVHcloud Control Panel, browse your Public Cloud Databases services, open the desired one and click the `Queries in progress`{.action} tab.
This table is regrouping ongoing queries with some filtering options, such as showing idle or active connections.

The query table shows the exact query, among with detailed information: PID (Process ID), Duration, Database, Client address and Application name.

In the table list, find the session you want to terminate then click the `...`{.action} button at the end of the line. You will be able to terminate the session and related backend process directly.

The query will disappear but if your client application is coded to redo the query after a failure, another query and PID will reappear.

### Terminate long-running queries with CLI (psql)

PostgreSQL CLI, called `psql`, provides native administration functions such as `pg_terminate_backend()`.

For more information, please refer to their [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html){.external}.

#### Connect to your database using psql

Please refer to this [guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/postgresql_03_connect_cli) to find out how to connect to your database using `psql`.

#### Make sure to get enough access privileges first

You can terminate a session only when you are the owner of the database.

To verify your roles and grants, run the following command in `psql`:

```sql
\l
```

It will return the list of databases and access privileges. As an example:

```bash
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 defaultdb | avnadmin | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | avnadmin
           |          |          |             |             | bastien
```

If you don't see your user, you will have to grant him with required access privileges on the appropriate database.
Otherwise, instructions below will return an error.

#### Find long-running queries

Once you are connected to your database, type for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state <> 'idle';
```

It will show you a list of queries, and PIDs.

For more information about statistics, please follow the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html).

#### Terminate a specific query

Now that you get the PID, you can terminate a specific query with the following command:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
```

Where `pid` is the unique identifier found during the previous step.
This command does not return any result when successful.

As explained here, the query will disappear if you check again the statistics, but if your client application is coded to launch again the query after a failure, another query and PID will reappear.
