## Objective

This articles discusses essential best practices for managing MongoDB post-deployment. Key areas of focus include monitoring, backup strategies, security measures, upgrade procedures, and user and roles management. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your MongoDB environment remains secure, reliable, and performant, thus maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of your database operations.

# MongoDB Post-Deployment Operational Best Practices

## 1. Monitoring

- **OVHcloud Built-in Monitoring Tools:**
  - [Metrics tab](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_15_monitoring): Provides comprehensive monitoring dashboards.
- **Third-Party Tools:**
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Integrates with MongoDB Exporter for metrics collection.
  - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus.
  - [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/mongo/?tab=replicaset): Offers deep MongoDB integration for metrics and alerts.
  - [Hatchet](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_17_why_mongodb): Parses the logs to help you identify slow queries.
    
- [**Key Metrics for Monitoring MongoDB Cluster**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/review-available-metrics/#review-available-metrics)
  - **Normalized System CPU**: 
    - Measures the percentage of CPU resources in use.
    - High CPU usage can indicate heavy load or the need for hardware scaling.

  - **Memory (RAM) Utilization**: 
    - Indicates the amount of RAM used by MongoDB.
    - High memory usage can enhance performance but may suggest the need for more RAM if consistently high.
      
  - **Cache Activity**
    - readInto (replica set) or cache read into (sharded cluster) displays the rate in bytes per second of data read from disk into memory to service queries.
    - writtenFrom (replica set) or cache written from (sharded cluster) displays the rate in bytes per second of data written from memory into disk to service writes.
   
    High cache activity indicates that the working set is not fitting into RAM. Therefore, it is advisable to increase the RAM size in this situation

  - **Disk Usage**: 
    - Shows the amount of disk space used by MongoDB data.
    - Monitoring helps ensure sufficient disk space to avoid performance issues or downtime.

  - **Replication Lag**: 
    - The delay between the primary and secondary nodes in a replica set.
    - High replication lag can affect data consistency and availability.

  - **Read/Write Tickets**: 
    - MongoDB controls the number of concurrent read and write operations using a ticketing system.
    - Monitoring used vs. available tickets helps identify potential workload bottlenecks.

  - **Disk IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**: 
    - Measures the speed of read and write operations on the disk.
    - High IOPS indicates good performance but may suggest the need for faster storage if consistently high.

  - **Network Latency**: 
    - Measures the time taken for data to travel between the client and the database server.
    - High network latency can slow down database operations and impact performance.

  - **Connections**: 
    - The number of active connections to the database.
    - A sudden increase can indicate a spike in traffic or issues with connection management.

  - **OpCounters (Operation Counters)**: 
    - Tracks the number of operations (insert, query, update, delete, getmore, command) executed by the database.
    - Helps understand workload and identify potential performance issues.

  - **Replication Oplog Window**: 
    - Indicates the time range covered by the operations log (oplog).
    - A larger oplog window provides more time for secondaries to catch up, which is crucial for data consistency during replication.


## 2. Backup

- **OVHcloud Automated Backup Solutions:**
  - [OVHcloud Automated Backup](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_05_automated_backups).
  - [OVHcloud Restore Backup](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_06_restore_backup)
- **Snapshot-based Backups**
  - [mongodump and mongorestore](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_06_howto_backup_restore): Regular snapshots of the data.
- **Backup Best Practices:**
  - **Frequency:** Regular backups (daily or hourly) depending on data criticality.
  - **Retention Policy:** Define retention policies to balance cost and availability.
  - **Testing:** Regularly test backup restoration to ensure data integrity.
  - **Encryption:** Ensure backups are encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 3. Security

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - **Enable Authentication:** Use SCRAM, LDAP, or Kerberos.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign specific roles and permissions.
- **Encryption:**
  - **At-Rest Encryption**: OVHcloud Advanced plan automatically encrypts data at REST.
  - **In-Transit Encryption:** TLS is enabled for all OVHcloud clusters.
- [Network Security:](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_02_manage_control_panel)
  - **Firewall:** Restrict access to MongoDB instances.
  - **IP Whitelisting:** Allow only trusted IP addresses to access the database.
- **Auditing:**
  - **Enable Auditing:** Track and log all access and administrative actions.
  - **Review Logs:** Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activities.

## 4. Upgrades

- **Version Compatibility:**
  - [**Check Compatibility:**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/about-compatibility/) Ensure new MongoDB versions are compatible with your [applications drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/).
  - [**Read Release Notes:**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/#release-notes) Understand new features, bug fixes, and deprecations.
- **Testing:**
  - **Test Environment:** Upgrade in a staging environment first.
  - **Data Integrity:** Ensure data consistency and integrity post-upgrade.
- **Backup Before Upgrade:**
  - **Full Backup:** Perform a full backup before starting the upgrade.
- **Upgrade Path:**
  - **Follow the Recommended Path:** Use the documented upgrade paths provided by MongoDB.

## 5. Users and Roles Management

- [**User Management:**](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_02_manage_control_panel)
  - **Create Users with Specific Roles:** Assign roles based on the principle of least privilege.
  - **Disable Unused Accounts:** Regularly review and disable inactive accounts.
- [**Role Management:**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/built-in-roles/#self-hosted-deployment-built-in-roles)
  - **Role Audit:** Periodically audit roles and permissions.
- **Password Management:**
  - **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies.
  - **Rotation Policies:** Implement regular password rotation policies.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - **Enable MFA:** OVHcloud offers already MFA.

## 6. Performance Tuning

  - [**Use Appropriate Indexes:**](https://github.com/ralphsawaya/ovh/blob/main/MongoDoc/mongodb_02_Best_practise_to_implement%20_your_first_mongoDB_instance/guide.en-gb.md#indexing) Create indexes to support query patterns and Regularly review and optimize indexes.
