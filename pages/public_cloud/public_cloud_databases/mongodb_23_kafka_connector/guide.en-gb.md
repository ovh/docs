## Introduction

The [MongoDB Kafka Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/#mongodb-kafka-connector) is an integration tool that bridges MongoDB with Apache Kafka, enabling real-time data synchronization and streaming between the two platforms. This connector facilitates the seamless transfer of data, allowing MongoDB to be used both as a source and a sink within a Kafka ecosystem. By leveraging this connector, developers can build robust data pipelines, ensuring efficient and reliable data flow across their applications.

## Quick Start Guide

Learn how to get started with the MongoDB Kafka Connector and begin working with data in the Kafka [Connector Quick Start](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/quick-start/#std-label-kafka-quick-start) section.

## Tutorials

Follow [tutorials](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/tutorials/#std-label-kafka-connector-tutorials) to learn how to set up the MongoDB Kafka Connector to read and write data for several use cases.

## Key Components

1. [Source Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/source-connector/#source-connector): Captures changes from MongoDB and streams them into Kafka topics. It uses MongoDBâ€™s Change Streams to monitor changes in collections and databases.
2. [Sink Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/sink-connector/#std-label-kafka-sink-overview): Reads data from Kafka topics and writes it into MongoDB collections. This component ensures that data from various Kafka topics can be persisted in MongoDB for further processing or querying.

### Setup Kafka Sink and Source Connectors

#### Step 1: Create `KafkaConnect` and `Kafka` services

Under `Data Streaming` create `KafkaConnect` and `Kafka` services.

#### Step 2: Integrate the `Kafka` service to `KafkaConnect`

Select the `Kafka Connect` service and under `Service Integration`, click the `+ Add an Integration` button and select `KafkaConnect` as integration type, an then add the `Kafka` service.

#### Step 3: Add the Connector 

Under `Connectors` tab in `KafkaConnect`, click the `+ Add a Connector` and then select either `MongoDB Kafka Sink Connector` or `MongoDB Kafka Source Connector`.

#### Step 4: Configure the Connector

You can refer to [Sink Connector Configuration Properties](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/sink-connector/configuration-properties/) and [Source Connector Configuration Properties](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/source-connector/configuration-properties/#source-connector-configuration-properties) to complete the setup.

## Monitoring

Learn how to [monitor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/monitoring/#std-label-kafka-monitoring) your MongoDB Kafka source and sink connectors in the Monitoring section.

## Troubleshooting

Learn how to resolve issues you may encounter while running the MongoDB Kafka Connector in the [Troubleshooting](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/troubleshooting/#std-label-kafka-troubleshooting) section.

## Use Cases

- **Data Streaming**: Real-time data streaming from MongoDB to Kafka for analytics and monitoring.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Using Kafka as a central hub for ETL processes, with MongoDB serving as a source or sink.
- **Microservices Integration**: Synchronizing data across microservices architectures, ensuring consistent data states.
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: Building event-driven systems where MongoDB and Kafka work together to handle events and triggers efficiently.
