excerpt: Connect to your Public Cloud Databases for Caching using RedisInsight

## Objective

Public Cloud Databases allow you to focus on building and deploying cloud applications while OVHcloud takes care of the database infrastructure and maintenance in operational conditions.

**This guide explains how to connect to a Caching service with the free GUI: RedisInsight.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- A [Caching service project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- A Caching service running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases ([this guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_01_order_control_panel) can help you to meet this requirement)
- [Configure your Caching service](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/redis_08_prepare_for_incoming_connections) to accept incoming connections
- A RedisInsight stable version installed and public network connectivity (Internet). This guide was made in RedisInsight 1.11.1

## Concept

A Caching service can be managed through multiple ways.
One of the easiest, yet powerful, is to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), as shown in our guide: [Connect with CLI](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/redis_03_connect_cli) or by using programming languages, such as [PHP](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/redis_04_connect_php).

Another way is to interact directly using the GUI: RedisInsight.

In order to do so, we will need to install RedisInsight, then configure our Public Cloud Databases for Caching services to accept incoming connections, and finally configure RedisInsight.

## Instructions

### Installation

To interact with your Caching service with RedisInsight you need to install it.

Please follow the official [RedisInsight](https://docs.redis.com/latest/ri/installing) to get the latest information.

We are now ready to learn how to connect to our Caching service.
