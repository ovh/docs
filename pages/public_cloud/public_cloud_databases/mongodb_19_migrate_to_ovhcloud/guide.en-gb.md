## Objective

This documentation is to provide a comprehensive approach to MongoDB database migration, ensuring data integrity, minimal downtime, and optimal performance. Whether you are migrating from:

- MongoDB instance to a new MongoDB OVHcloud instance.
- Any Document DB to MongoDB OVHcloud instance.

This guide covers the essential tools and processes required for a successful migration.

## Migration Tools

### Tools With Expected Downtime

These tools are used during migration processes where some expected downtime.

#### 1. mongodump

[mongodump](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/) is a utility for creating a binary export of the contents of a MongoDB database. It is particularly useful for backing up databases and migrating data between MongoDB instances.

Use the [`--dumpDbUsersAndRoles`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/#std-option-mongodump.--dumpDbUsersAndRoles) option to include user and role definitions in the database's dump directory when performing mongodump on a specific database. This option applies only when you specify a database in the --db option

#### 2. mongorestore

[mongorestore](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/) complements mongodump by allowing you to restore a binary dump created by mongodump. This tool is essential for restoring data to a MongoDB instance.

Use the [`restoreDbUsersAndRoles`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/#std-option-mongorestore.--restoreDbUsersAndRoles) option to Restore user and role definitions for the given database. Restoring the admin database by specifying `--db admin` to mongorestore already restores all users and roles.

### Tools With Minimal Downtime

These tools are designed to minimize downtime during the migration process.

#### 1. mongosync

The [mongosync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/mongosync/) binary is the primary process used in Cluster-to-Cluster Sync. provides you with continuous, uni-directional data synchronization of MongoDB clusters in the same or different environments. Check the mongosync [limitations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/limitations/) before starting the migration.

#### 2. MongoDB Kafka Connector

[MongoDB Kafka Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/) allows you to integrate MongoDB with Apache Kafka, enabling real-time data synchronization and minimizing downtime during migrations by streaming data changes directly to MongoDB.

# Migration Strategy

## 1. Preparation

### Assess Current Environment

- **Metrics Collection**: Collect current metrics such as CPU usage, RAM, IOPS, disk space, and network usage. This will help you choose the appropriate OVHcloud cluster size.
- **Backup**: Create a comprehensive backup of your current MongoDB instance.

### Select OVHcloud Plan

- Based on the metrics collected (CPU, RAM, Disk IOPS, Disk Space, etc.), choose an OVHcloud plan that meets or exceeds the current specifications of your MongoDB instance.
- Consider future growth and scalability needs. You might want to consider how to [size a MongoDB cluster](https://github.com/ralphsawaya/ovh/blob/main/MongoDoc/mongodb_02_Best_practise_to_implement%20_your_first_mongoDB_instance/guide.en-gb.md#mongodb-cluster-sizing).

## 2. Setup OVHcloud Cluster

- **Create Cluster**: [Set up the new OVH managed MongoDB cluster](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-public-cloud-databases-getting-started?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0048745).
- **Configuration**: Configure the OVHcloud cluster settings to match your current MongoDB cluster's configuration as closely as possible.

## 3. Data Migration Tools

Use one of the tools mentioned in the [previous section](https://github.com/ralphsawaya/ovh/blob/main/MongoDoc/mongodb_03_Move%20to%20OVHcloud%20mongoDB%20managed%20from%20an%20existing%20mongoDB%20instance/guide.en-gb.md#migration-tools).

## 4. Migration Execution

### Schedule Migration

- Plan the migration during a maintenance window to minimize impact.
- Inform stakeholders of potential downtime.

### Migrate Data

- Execute the chosen migration method.
- Monitor the process to ensure data is transferred correctly.

### Cut Off Process

- **Continuous Synchronization**: If using `mongosync`  mentioned in the [previous section](https://github.com/ralphsawaya/ovh/blob/main/MongoDoc/mongodb_03_Move%20to%20OVHcloud%20mongoDB%20managed%20from%20an%20existing%20mongoDB%20instance/guide.en-gb.md#migration-tools), which offer continuous synchronization, monitor the synchronization logs.
- **Identify Synchronization Lag**: Wait until the logs indicate that the target cluster is only a few seconds behind (e.g., 2 seconds) the source cluster.
- **Stop Writes to Source Cluster**: At this point, stop all write operations to the source cluster to ensure no data loss.
- **Update Application Configuration**: Change the application configuration to point to the new OVHcloud cluster.
- **Deploy Changes**: Deploy the updated configuration to your application.
- **Restart Application**: Restart the application to begin using the new OVHcloud target cluster.

## 5. Post-Migration Tasks

### Verify Data

- Validate that all data has been transferred and is accessible.
- Check for any discrepancies or missing data.

### Monitor Performance
- Continuously monitor the new OVHcloud cluster to ensure it meets performance expectations.
- Adjust configurations as needed based on performance metrics.
