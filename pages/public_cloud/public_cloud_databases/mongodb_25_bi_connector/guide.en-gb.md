## Introduction

Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Tableau and Power BI are popular products for data visualization and analysis. They enable users to transform raw data into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards and reports. The [MongoDB BI Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/) allows you to create queries with SQL to visualize, graph, and report on your three-dimensional MongoDB data using relational business intelligence tools.

The MongoDB BI Connector acts as a bridge between MongoDB and BI tools, allowing you to visualize and analyze your MongoDB data without complex data transformations. This guide will cover the installation of the BI Connector, configuration, and connection of your BI tool to OVHcloud cluster.

## Quick Start Guide

Refer to the MongoDB documentation for a [Quick Start Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/local-quickstart/#quick-start-guide-for-windows).

## Connect the BI tool to the OVHcloud cluster

### Step 1: Install the BI Connector

Refer to the MongoDB documentation for [installing the BI connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/installation/#install-bi-connector-on-premises).

### Step 2: Launch the BI Connector

Refer to the MongoDB documentation for [launching the BI Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/launch/#launch-bi-connector)

below is an example for starting the connector with the OVHcloud cluster via the command line:

```javascript
mongosqld --mongo-uri "mongodb://node2-0b70a1b78fff6c0e.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017,node1-0b70a1b78fff6c0e.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017,node3-0b70a1b78fff6c0e.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017/" --auth -u myuser -p mypassword --mongo-ssl
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that the IP address of the machine running mongosqld is authorized in your OVHcloud MongoDB cluster.

Refer to the MongoDB documentation on launching the BI Connector via the [command line](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/launch/#start-mongosqld-from-the-command-line) or [system service](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/launch/#install-mongosqld-as-a-system-service).
