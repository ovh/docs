title: Public Cloud Databases - How to configure your Private Network
excerpt: Connect a Public Cloud Database to vRack
updated: 2023-08-17

## Objective

The OVHcloud vRack is a private network solution that enables our customers to route traffic between OVHcloud dedicated servers as well as other OVHcloud services, such as databases. The vRack also allows you to add Public Cloud instances to your private network to create an infrastructure of physical and virtual resources.

**This guide explains how to connect a Public Cloud Instance, hosted in a datacenter, to a Public Cloud Database, hosted in another datacenter, like this:**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pl/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account.

## Considerations
Here are some considerations to take into account when using private network:

- Network ports are created in the private network of your choice. Thus, further operations on that network might be restricted - e.g. you won’t be able to delete the network if you didn’t stop the Public Cloud Databases services first.
- When connecting from an outside subnet, the Openstack IP gateway must be enabled in the subnet used for the Database service. The customer is responsible for any other custom network setup.
- Subnet sizing should include considerations for service nodes, other co-located services within the same subnet, and an allocation of additional available IP addresses for maintenance purposes. Failure to adequately size subnets could result in operational challenges and the malfunctioning of services.
- OpenStack subnets routes announcement will not be applied to your services. 

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Creating a virtual network

The first step is to create the virtual network that will be used in your vRack. To proceed, consult this [guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-07-creating-vrack).

### Step 2 - Creating a Public Cloud Database connected to the private network

Follow this [guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_01_order_control_panel) to create a new Public Cloud Database.

> Choose the plan that best fits your needs. The use of private networking with databases is available with all plans.

> - Select **Private** from the Network Type list, then select **XXXX - my-private-nw**.
> *The XXX value is the ID of the vRack.*
>
> - From the Subnetwork list, select the **10.0.0.0/16 - YYY**.
> *The YYY value is the name of the datacenter you chose.*

### Step 3 - Configure your Public Cloud database instance to accept incoming connections

Follow the *Configure your \<database> instance to accept incoming connections* guide of your selected database type available [here](/products/public-cloud-databases) to configure your service after installation.

> Authorize the whole private network, as defined on previous steps.

The database is now connected to the virtual network, we can use it from any component that is connected to the same vRack.

### Step 4 - Adding a Public Cloud Instance to the vRack

Follow this [guide](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps) to create a new Public Cloud Instance

> At the fourth step, select the desired virtual network **XXXX - my-private-network**.

>If you want to test the access from an existing instance, read this tutorial to connect it to the vRack: [Configuring vRack for Public Cloud](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-07-creating-vrack#in-case-of-an-existing-instance).

### Step 5 - Example of verification with a Public Cloud Databases for Caching

We assume that you have an already set SSH key on your project. For more details, read the [Creating and connecting to your first Public Cloud instance](/pages/public_cloud/compute/public-cloud-first-steps) page.

Connect to the instance via SSH:

```bash
ssh debian@141.95.107.2
```

Now install the client by installing the `redis-server` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install redis-server -y
```

Now connect to the Caching service using the URL retrieved from the OVHcloud Control Panel, with a command such as:

```bash
redis-cli --tls -u "rediss://my-redis-user@redis-2612345abc-abcd1234defg.database.cloud.ovh.net:20185"
```

Authenticate yourself with the AUTH command:

```bash
AUTH my-redis-user myRedisUserPassword
```

Test the overall operation with these sample commands:

```bash
redis-2612345abc-abcd1234defg.database.cloud.ovh.net:20185> ping
PONG
redis-2612345abc-abcd1234defg.database.cloud.ovh.net:20185> SET mykey.test test
OK
redis-2612345abc-abcd1234defg.database.cloud.ovh.net:20185> GET mykey.test
"test"
```
