## Objective

Learn how to adjust the storage space of your cluster according to your needs.

> [!primary]
>
> This feature is only available for engines that use storage space.
>

## How to increase or decrease storage

You can increase or decrease the storage of your service at any time using either the OVHcloud [API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/) or the [Control Panel](/links/manager).

> [!primary]
>
> When changing the storage space of your service, the system checks that at least 20% of you total storage space will remain free after the resize operation. As a consequence, you might not be able to perform a storage space decrease if the new size you request is too close to your current disk space usage.

### How to adjust the storage space using the Control Panel

#### Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) 
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

#### Instructions

To adjust the storage space of your cluster, log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel and open your Public Cloud project. Click `Databases`{.action} in the left navigation bar, select your engine instance then click the `General Information`{.action} tab.

### How to adjust the storage space using the API

#### Requirements

- Access to the OVHcloud [API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/){.external} (create your credentials by consulting [this guide](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps))
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

#### Instructions

As an example, for MongoDB services, you can perform a storage space increase or decrease using this endpoint:

> [!api]
> @api {v1} /cloud PUT /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/mongodb/{clusterId}

Other engines using a storage space provide similar endpoints, e.g.:

> [!api]
> @api {v1} /cloud PUT /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/postgresql/{clusterId}
