## Objective

Public Cloud managed databases allow you to send logs of your service to your own Logs Data Platform (LDP) data stream.

**This guide explains how to forward service logs to your own LDP stream with the OVHcloud API.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- A [Public Cloud database service](https://www.ovhcloud.com/es-es/public-cloud/databases/) up and running
- Access to the [OVHcloud API](https://eu.api.ovh.com/console/)
- A Logs Data Platform account within this OVHcloud account with at least one destination stream configured
- A running database service

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Retrieve the required information

#### Retrieve your LDP destination `streamId`:

- In the OVHcloud Control Panel, go to your LDP page.
- Go to the `Data stream` tab.
- Choose your target stream and click on `Edit`{.action}.
- You can see the `streamId` in the URL `https://.../streams/<streamId>/edit`.

#### Retrieve your LDP destination `serviceName`:

- It refers to your Public Cloud project ID.

#### Retrieve your `clusterId`:

- In the OVHcloud Control Panel, go to your database.
- You can see the field `Cluster ID`.

### Step 2 - Create your subscription

Use the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /cloud POST /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/{engine}/{clusterId}/log/subscription
>

```console
body : {
    streamId: <LDP destination stream ID>
}
```
Then logs will start to be forwarded to your LDP stream.

### Find logs in Graylog

To find logs of your service in your graylogs stream you can use the following graylog queries:

#### MongoDB

Query: `cluster: "<HostID>"`

You can find this `HostID` in your OVHcloud Control Panel:

- In `Login information` switch `Service` to `mongodb`
- Now you can see the `Host` field with the format `<HostID>.database.cloud.ovh.net`

#### Other Engines

Query: `clusterID: "<Engine>-<HostID>"`

You can find this `HostID` in your OVHcloud Control Panel:

- Find the Cluster ID formatted as a UUID (AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDDDDDDDDDD)
- `HostID` is the first part of the UUID (AAAAAAAA)

### Delete subscription

You have 2 methods to delete a subscription:

- You can delete subscriptions using the `subscriptionId` concerned in this API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /cloud DELETE /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/mongodb/{clusterId}/log/subscription/{subscriptionId}
>

- If you delete your database service, all subscriptions of this service are deleted automatically.
