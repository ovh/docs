# Objective

This guide aims to provide a detailed, step-by-step approach to benchmarking and sizing your OVHcloud MongoDB cluster based on specific loads. It covers estimating resource requirements, configuring the cluster, and using tools like YCSB and SimRunner for performance testing. By following this guide, you will be able to measure throughput, latency, and make informed decisions about the appropriate OVHcloud plan to meet your application's needs, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

## Setting Up Benchmarking Tools

### YCSB (Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark)

[YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB) is a framework for benchmarking and comparing the performance of various databases. It supports a wide range of workloads and provides a standardized way to measure throughput and latency.

- Go through the [README](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/?tab=readme-ov-file#links) to install YCSB.
- Refer to the [MongoDB README](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/mongodb) to run YCSB on MongoDB.

### SimRunner

[SimRunner](https://github.com/schambon/SimRunner) is a tool that binds:

- a powerful data generator for MongoDB.
- a declarative and highly scalable workload generator.

Install SimRunner and configure it to simulate the load based on your current database metrics, and then create a configuration file for SimRunner that mimics your current workload.

## Benchmark Process with YCSB and SimRunner

> [!WARNING]  
> With YCSB version 0.17.0, make sure you have Python 2 installed, as YCSB will encounter errors if Python 3 is used.

### Step 0: Set up an OVHcloud MongoDB Cluster

- [Set up the OVHcloud MongoDB cluster](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-public-cloud-databases-getting-started?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0048745). Make sure to select a plan with similar hardware specifications compared to the other databases with which you would like to benchmark.

### Step 1: Determine The Primary Node of MongoDB Cluster

1. Connect to the MongoDB cluster with the mongoshell, and then issue the command `rs.status()`.
2. Find the element with `members.stateStr: 'PRIMARY'` .
3. Take note of the value of the `members.name` field for that element. eg. `name: 'node2-0b70a1b78fff6c0e-admin.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017'`. You will use it in STEP 3 to load and run YCSB.

### Step 2: Configure The YCSB Workload

YCSB provide pre-configured workloads under the `ycsb-0.17.0 > workloads` folder. You can setup your own workload based on the behavior of your application. 
>[!NOTE]
>See [YCSB Core Properties ](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties) for the list of available workload properties.

Here is an example of a workload:

```javascript
# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software

# implied. See the License for the specific language governing                                                                                                                    
# permissions and limitations under the License. See accompanying                                                                                                                 
# LICENSE file.                                                                                                                                                                   


# Yahoo! Cloud System Benchmark
# Workload A: Update heavy workload
#   Application example: Session store recording recent actions
#                        
#   Read/update ratio: 50/50
#   Default data size: 1 KB records (10 fields, 100 bytes each, plus key)
#   Request distribution: zipfian

recordcount=1000
operationcount=1000
workload=site.ycsb.workloads.CoreWorkload

readallfields=true

readproportion=0.5
updateproportion=0.5
scanproportion=0
insertproportion=0

requestdistribution=zipfian
```

### Step 3: Load Data into MongoDB with YCSB - Example Loading the Provided `workloada`

>[!NOTE]
>For more details on how to run a workload, see [YCSB Run a Workload](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload).

While located in the `ycsb-0.17.0` directory, execute the following command with the provided `workloada` to load data into MongoDB.
```javascript
./bin/ycsb load mongodb -p mongodb.url="mongodb://myuser:mypassword@node2-0b70a1b78fff6c0e.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017/admin?replicaSet=replicaset&ssl=true" -s -P workloads/workloada
```
![alt text](./images/YCSBLoad.png)

Verify that the database `ycsb` and collection `usertable` got created and loaded with data.

### Step 4: Run The YCSB Workload - Example Running the Provided `workloada`

While located in the `YCSB > ycsb-0.17.0` directory, execute the following command with the provided `workloada` to run the workload.
```javascript
./bin/ycsb run mongodb -p mongodb.url="mongodb://myuser:mypassword@node2-0b70a1b78fff6c0e.database.cloud.ovh.net:27017/admin?replicaSet=replicaset&ssl=true" -s -P workloads/workloada
```

### Step 5: Analyze and Benchmark the YCSB Output Metrics

Take note of the run command output in Step 4, and benchmark it with other databases.

## Performance Testing With SimRunner

### Step 1: Select OVHcloud Plan

Now that you have selected MongoDB as your database, it is time to setup the appropriate cluster.
- Based on the metrics collected (CPU, RAM, Disk IOPS, Disk Space, etc.), choose an OVHcloud plan that meets the requirements of your application.
- Consider future growth and scalability needs. You might want to consider how to [size a MongoDB cluster](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_18_cluster_sizing).

### Step 2: Setup OVHcloud Cluster

- [Set up the OVHcloud MongoDB cluster](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/databases_01_order_control_panel).

### Step 3: Performance Testing With SimRunner 

- Go through the [README](https://github.com/schambon/SimRunner?tab=readme-ov-file#) to install and run SimRunner.
- Run performance tests using SimRunner on your MongoDB cluster: `java -jar SimRunner.jar <config file>`. Here is an example of a configuration file:

```json
{
    "connectionString": "mongodb+srv://myuser:mypassword@mongodb-8fff6c0e-o01ba0bef.database.cloud.ovh.net/admin?replicaSet=replicaset&ssl=true",
    "reportInterval": 1000,
    "http": {
        "enabled": false,
        "port": 3000,
        "host": "localhost"
    },
    "mongoReporter": {
        "enabled": true,
        "connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "database": "simrunner",
        "collection": "report",
        "drop": false,
        "runtimeSuffix": false
    },
    "templates": [
        {
            "name": "person",
            "database": "test",
            "collection": "people",
            "drop": false,
            "template": {
                "_id": "%objectid",
                "first": "%name.firstName",
                "last": "%name.lastName",
                "birthday": "%date.birthday"
            },
            "remember": ["_id", { "field": "first", "preload": false}],
            "indexes": []
        }
    ],
    "workloads": [
        {
            "name": "Insert some people",
            "template": "person",
            "op": "insert",
            "threads": 1,
            "pace": 100,
            "batch": 1000
        },
        {
            "name": "Find people by key",
            "template": "person",
            "op": "find",
            "params": {
                "filter": { "_id": "#_id" }
            },
            "threads": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

- The report output, `mongoReporter`,  of the execution was set to be stored on the locally running MongoDB: `"connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017"`

## Step 4: Validation

- Monitor the performance and adjust the cluster size and configurations as required by the application.
- Validate that your application performs as expected with MongoDB.
