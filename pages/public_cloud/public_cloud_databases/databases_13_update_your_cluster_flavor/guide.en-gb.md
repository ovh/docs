## How to upgrade your flavor

This option is available through the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/) and [Control Panel](/links/manager).

### Requirements

- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) or to the [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/)
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

### Instructions

To adjust the flavor of your cluster, log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel and open your Public Cloud project. Click `Databases`{.action} in the left navigation bar, select your engine instance then click the `General Information`{.action} tab.

## How to downgrade your flavor

This option is currently available via the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/).

### Requirements

- Access to the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovh.com/){.external} (create your credentials by consulting [this guide](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps))
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

### Instructions

In order to be able to downgrade your flavor, you must have a threshold of 20% between your current disk space used (base storage + additional storage) and the maximum storage space allowed for the flavor.

For instance, if you have a PostgreSQL cluster with db1-15 as flavor and less than 384 GB (80% of 480GB) of disk space used, you can decrease the flavor to db1-7 on that endpoint:

> [!api]
> @api {v1} /cloud PUT /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/mongodb/{clusterId}
