A Docker Registry is a system that lets you store and distribute your Docker images. The best known Registry is the official [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/){.external}, where you can find official public images such as [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine){.external}, [Golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang){.external} or [Debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian){.external}.

Today, OVHcloud allows you to spawn your own authenticated Docker Registry where you can privately store your Docker images. This is the best way to use your private images with our OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service offer without exposing them to everyone.

## Objective

OVHcloud Managed Private Registry service provides you a managed, authenticated Docker registry where you can privately store your Docker images. This guide will explain how to create your Private Registry.

## Instructions

1. First, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

1. In the left menu, in the `Containers & Orchestration`{.action} section, select `Managed Private Registry`{.action}.
