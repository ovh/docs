## Objective

Managed Rancher Service by OVHcloud provides a powerful platform for orchestrating Kubernetes clusters seamlessly. In this guide we will explore how to import an existing Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](/links/public-cloud/public-cloud) in your OVHcloud account
- An OVHcloud Managed Rancher Service (see the [creating a Managed Rancher Service](/pages/public_cloud/containers_orchestration/managed_rancher_service/create-update-rancher) guide for more information)
- An access to the Rancher UI to operate it (see the [connecting to the Rancher UI](/pages/public_cloud/containers_orchestration/managed_rancher_service/create-update-rancher) guide for more information)

## Instructions

#### Importing an existing OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service cluster

If you already use our [OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service](/links/public-cloud/kubernetes), you can easily import an existing cluster.

Log in your Managed Rancher Service UI.

Click on the `Import Existing`{.action} button and select **Generic** driver to import any Kubernetes cluster.

Enter the Cluster Name (it is not mandatory to match the name of your existing MKS cluster), then click on `Create`{.action} (at the bottom right of the screen).

Follow the instructions provided on the **Registration** tab.

Run the provided `kubectl` command on your existing Managed Kubernetes Service (MKS) cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://xxxxxx.xxxx.rancher.ovh.net/v3/import/xxxxxxxxxxxx/file.yaml
```

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://xxxxxx.p7mg.rancher.ovh.net/v3/import/b2n8xw5nxt8qhd4xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_c-m-2brxmwcz.yaml

```

Wait until your cluster becomes **Active**:

Your existing Kubernetes cluster is now federated on your Rancher.

Now you can click on the **Explore** button to manage your MKS cluster.

#### Importing an existing Kubernetes cluster

For organizations with pre-existing Kubernetes clusters, Rancher simplifies integration. Import your clusters seamlessly, wherever they're deployed, and let Rancher take over management responsibilities. This process facilitates the transition to Rancher without disrupting your existing infrastructure.

You can refer to the official Rancher documentation on how to [Register Existing Cluster](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/register-existing-clusters).
