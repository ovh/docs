- telecom services (e.g. xDSL, VoIP, etc. - not available in the UK)

The page that appears will contain a table for managing your OVH solutions. In this table, you will see:

- the service’s name
- its name at OVH (may look like a reference ID)
- its renewal or expiry date
- its renewal frequency

Some services may be connected (e.g. a Web Hosting plan and a domain name). If this is the case, you can disconnect them from one another by clicking on the arrow button in the table.

- sort your services by several criteria, using the filters located at the top of the table
