The page that appears will contain a table for managing your OVHcloud services. In this table, you will see:

- its renewal or expiry date
- its renewal frequency

If you have several solutions, the table may be more than one page long. You can use filters to:

- show a particular service by entering its name in the search field above the table, in the right-hand corner
- sort your services by several criteria, using the filters located at the top of the table 
- change the number of services displayed per page, by selecting a number from the drop-down menu below the table

The page that appears will contain a table for managing your OVHcloud solutions. If applicable for the service in question, you can:

- cancel a service on its expiry date
- delete a service immediately
- perform other actions related to payment for the service. For these options, please refer to the instructions explained in [our renewal guide](../how-to-use-automatic-renewal-at-ovh/).

As a reminder, some solutions cannot be managed via the “My services” interface.

#### Cancel a service on its expiry date.

This action disables automatic renewal for the service concerned. The service will be cancelled automatically on its expiry date. **Please note that all of the data associated with this service will be permanently deleted.** 

To cancel a service, click on the three dots to the right of it. Then click `Terminate on expiry date`{.action}, read the information that appears, and confirm your request.

You can undo this action up to 24 hours before the expiry date by clicking again on the three dots, then `Undo termination`{.action}.

#### Delete a service immediately.

This action is only available for [Web Hosting plans](https://www.ovh.co.uk/web-hosting/). It will trigger the deletion process for the service, meaning the service will be deleted before its expiry date, without waiting for the contract duration to end.

**Since this action is immediate, all of the data associated with this service is permenantly deleted, and the action cannot be undone.** Also, no refund is issued for the time between the service’s deletion and its expiry date.

To delete a service immediately, click on the three dots to the right of it, and click `Delete web hosting plan immediately`{.action}. Read the information that appears, then launch your request by pressing `confirm`{.action}. Follow the instructions you receive via email to complete the action.
