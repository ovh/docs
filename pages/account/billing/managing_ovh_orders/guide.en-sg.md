The various order statuses are listed below:

|Status|Definition|

|Being processed|Your order is in the process of being delivered — please wait. Depending on the service you have ordered, this step may last a few minutes or a few hours.|
|Complete|You have received your order and your access details have been sent to you by email (if access details are required).|

You can also view the purchase order in HTML format by clicking on `...`{.action} to the right of your order, then `View order in HTML format`{.action}.
