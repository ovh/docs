### Purchase order

A purchase order is generated when you place an order. It lists the products ordered, their price, and any reductions or promo offers that have been applied.

|Number|Description|
|---|---|
|1|All of the information related to the purchase order is listed here: its number, its creation date and its expiry date. Please note that expired purchase orders will no longer appear in your Control Panel.|
|2|If you are logged in to the Control Panel when you place the order, the billing contact will appear here. For further information on the different contact types, please read [this guide](../../customer/managing-contacts/).|
|3|If you have set a default payment method, it will be offered here. If your product is renewed automatically, a default payment method is required.|
|4|Here, you will find the available payment methods. We can only offer the payment methods authorised in the account’s country of origin, or those linked to the account type.|

You can view your purchase order at any time in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, as explained below.

### Accessing purchase orders via the OVHcloud Control Panel

On this page, you will see the following information:

- the date on which the order was placed
- the order number
- the order status
- the purchase order amount, including VAT

The various order statuses are listed below:

|Status|Definition|
|---|---|
|Unpaid|This status means that the payment has not been received for the purchase order. Payment is not obligatory. The order will not be finalised, and it will disappear on its expiry date.|
|Confirmation|Your order is in the process of being verified manually by our internal services (working days only). The validation will be complete once this step is finalised. If the operation cannot be finalised, you will be sent an email request to provide supporting documents.|
|Being processed|Your order is in the process of being delivered — please wait. Depending on the service you have ordered, this step may last a few minutes or a few hours.|
|Complete|You have received your order, and your access details have been sent to you by email (if access details are required).|

You can also view the purchase order in HTML format by clicking on `...`{.action} to the right of your order, then `View order in HTML format`{.action}.
