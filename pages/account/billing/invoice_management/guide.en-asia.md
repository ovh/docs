Your OVHcloud service bill is sent to you following the payment of an order or a renewal. It summarises the amounts corresponding to the purchase or renewal of your products, as well as their periods of validity.

You will then land on a page summarising your bills:

> [!primary]

> If an invoice is pending payment (`Unpaid` status), the amount due will be shown in red in the `Balance` column.
>

On each row of the table, you will see the following information:

- The invoice `Reference`{.action}
- The `Order Number`{.action}
- The `Issue Date`{.action}
- Its `Amount ex. VAT`{.action}
- Its `Amount incl. VAT`{.action}
- The `Balance`{.action} to be settled
- The invoice `Status`{.action} (`Unpaid` or `Paid`)

By clicking on one of the `...`{.action} buttons to the right of the table, you can also access these functions:

##### **Filters**

Several filters are available:

To find a specific invoice, you can enter its reference, the associated order number or its issue date.

##### **Batch actions**

Using the `Batch actions`{.action} menu, you can export your invoice summary in *.csv* or *.pdf* format. The files created will show their amount, reference and issue date.

If you want to export all of your invoices, use the `Export all as CSV`{.action} or `Export all as PDF`{.action} button.

![export_all](images/export_all.png){.thumbnail}

If you want to export only selected invoices, use the corresponding check boxes in the first column of the table to select the invoices you want to export. Two new actions, `Export selection in CSV format`{.action} and `Export selection in PDF format`{.action}, will then be available in the `Batch actions`{.action}.

![export_selection](images/export_selection.png){.thumbnail}

#### Pay your bills

To pay bills that are awaiting payment, simply click on the `Batch actions`{.action} menu, then select `Pay balance immediately`{.action}.

![Pay a due amount](images/pay_debt.png){.thumbnail}

A [settlement purchase order](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/managing-ovh-orders/#purchase-order) will then be created. Once the payment has been made, your account will be balanced again.

#### Request invoice cancellation

> [!primary]
>
> To request that your service be cancelled on the expiry date, follow the instructions in [this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/how-to-cancel-your-services/).

### Track your payments

You can find the payment history in `My bills`{.action} if you click on the `Payment tracking`{.action} tab. You can then link each invoice to the associated payment.
