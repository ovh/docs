## Objective

You want to cancel one or more OVHcloud services. This guide will show you how to cancel your subscription via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia).

First of all, read the section "[What happens when an OVHcloud service is cancelled?](#consequences)". Then select the concerned product in the section "[How do I cancel my subscription?](#terminate)".

> [!primary]
>
> Getting your opinion is essential for us. This means we can develop our services to suit your needs and expectations.
>
> Please tell us more about your personal experience with OVHcloud by filling in the cancellation form. We thank you in advance for your contribution to the improvement of our products.
>

## What happens when an OVHcloud service is cancelled? <a name="consequences"></a>

When an OVHcloud service is cancelled, it will be interrupted **permanently** when the current subscription ends (with an exception, however, for [domain names](#domain)). You can cancel your service or [stop a cancellation request](#cancel) up to 24 hours before the subscription end date.

If this is an email solution, a server or Web Hosting plan, all of the data concerned will be deleted **without any possibility of recovery**.

If it is a domain name or a telephone number, it will be recirculated and therefore might be **ordered by other customers**.

This means that, before any termination, you must be **certain** that:

- The operation will only affect a service you no longer want to use.
- You have a *functional* solution to replace it, if necessary.
- You have backed up all of the data concerned, if required.

## How do I cancel my subscription? <a name="terminate"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> Termination can only be applied if the following conditions are met:
>
> - You are the "administrative contact" for the service (for more information, see [this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/customer/managing-contacts/#definition)).
> - The service is not manually renewed.
> - The service is not suspended, particularly because an invoice has not been paid.

OVHcloud Public Cloud is based on the principle of *Pay-as-you-go* (more details are available on our information page about the [Public Cloud billing method](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/public-cloud/information-on-cloud-billing-options/)). At the end of the month, you only pay for the effective resource usage time.

You can also [view your current resource usage](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/public-cloud/information-on-cloud-billing-options/#view-your-current-resource-usage) in the OVHcloud Control Panel and receive email alerts when your resource usage is projected to exceed a certain threshold.

> Following your cancellation and at the end of your current subscription, your generic domain name (.com, .org, .net, etc.) remains "reserved" to you during the grace period (5 days) and then during the period of "redemption" (35 to 40 additional days), which means that only you will be able to renew it during these periods.
>
