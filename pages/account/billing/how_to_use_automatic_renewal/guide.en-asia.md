## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia)
- Active OVHcloud services
- Access as a [billing contact](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/customer/managing-contacts/#definition) to your OVHcloud services

## Instructions

When you place orders, your services are set to be automatically renewed on their expiry date. Payments are taken via the default payment method saved in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia). You can cancel these services at any time via the OVHcloud Control Panel. They will not be renewed once their validity period has ended.

You can also set certain products (domain names, Web Hosting plans, VPS, dedicated servers) to *manual* renewal, if you do not wish to renew and pay them automatically.

We recommend reading the following guides and focusing on the operations you wish to carry out:

- [Display the renewal statuses for your services](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/how-to-use-automatic-renewal-at-ovh/#display-the-renewal-statuses-for-your-services): This guide will help you check if your services are renewed automatically. You can also retrieve their renewal or expiry dates.

- [Manage renewal for your services](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/how-to-use-automatic-renewal-at-ovh/#renewal-at-ovhcloud): This guide will help you enable or disable automatic renewal, change a service’s payment frequency and pay for renewals before their expiry date.

- [Manage your payment methods](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/manage-payment-methods/): Using this guide, you can check that you have a saved payment method for future renewals. You can also add and delete payment methods, if required.

### Access your service’s settings

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia). Click on the name associated with your NIC handle (Customer ID) in the menu bar at the top right-hand corner then choose `Products and services`{.action}.

### Display the renewal statuses for your services

The `My services` page contains a table for managing your OVHcloud services. You can find their name, type, availability (if it is suspended, for example), status (renewal type, action to be performed, etc.) and the date by which the action to be performed will be effective.

![manageautomaticrenewal](images/manageautorenew2b.png){.thumbnail}

You can sort the columns by ascending or descending order, use the search field or apply a filter to display only some of your services based on your chosen criteria.

![manageautomaticrenewal](images/manageautorenew3.png){.thumbnail}

Your filter criteria will then be displayed above the table. Below is an example of a filter that can be used to display web hosting plans that have bills pending payment.

### Automatic renewal

When you subscribe to a service, it is set to **automatic renewal** by default. This setting means you can ensure your services are systematically renewed on their expiry date. Also, if you have registered a payment method in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia), it will be used to pay for your bills automatically.

If you have not registered a [payment method](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/manage-payment-methods/), an invoice will be sent to you by email. You can then pay it online.

For services with an automatic renewal frequency higher than 1 month (3 months, 6 months, 12 months), you will also be sent an email reminder the month before, listing the services that will need to be renewed soon.

If you do not wish to renew one of these services, simply [cancel it via the OVHcloud Control Panel](https://docs.ovh.com/asia/en/billing/how-to-cancel-your-services/).

### Manual renewal

For some OVHcloud products (domains, hosting plans, VPS, dedicated servers), you can also switch to manual **renewal**. This renewal method is useful if you are not sure whether you want to keep the service on its expiry date, or if you do not want your bills to be deducted automatically from your payment method. 

If you select this mode, you will receive several reminder emails before the expiry date, each containing a link for renewing your services online before the expiry date. You can also pay via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia).

> [!warning]
>
> If you do not pay for a service in manual renewal, it is suspended on its expiry date, then deleted after a few days.
>
> It is therefore not necessary to request the cancellation if you do not want to keep this service.

### Manage renewal for your services <a name="renewal-management"></a>
