## Objective

This guide explains the Purchase Order (PO) number applied to OVHcloud billing.

## Instructions

### Purchase Order (PO) number

When purchasing goods or services, companies are required to validate purchase orders. Most of the time, this validation is done by returning a document (paper or digital format) on the company's letterhead that recalls the goods or services purchased while specifying an order number. This document is usually called **Purchase Order** and is abbreviated to **PO**.

For the company issuing the PO, the purpose of this document is to control purchases of goods and services from its suppliers, including by requiring that all invoices issued include a PO Number.

There are essentially two types of orders, described below.

#### Closed order / Purchase Order (PO)

This is a document confirming the order of goods or services for a fixed quantity and for a fixed duration.

For OVHcloud, the document must contain at least the following information:

- Company name of the contractor
- Order number
- Type(s) of services ordered
- Quantities
- Unit prices
- Effective date
- End date

#### Open order / Blanket Purchase Order (BPO)

This is a document confirming the order of goods or services for a variable quantity with a maximum amount and for a fixed duration.

For OVHcloud, the document must contain at least the following information:

- Company name of the contractor
- Order number
- Type(s) of services ordered
- Unit prices
- Total order amount
- Effective date
- End date

### How to enter a Purchase Order (PO) reference in your OVHcloud Control Panel

You can use two different wordings, depending on whether you wish to display the word `Internal reference` **or**  the word `Purchase order` on your invoices.<br>
Select either `Create your internal reference`{.action} or `Create your purchase order`{.action}.

Give your internal reference / purchase order a name in the field provided, enter a **start date** and an **end date** (the end date is excluded) then click on `Validate`{.action}.

> [!primary]
> You cannot create 2 internal references / Purchase Orders over the same time period.

This reference will then appear on your next invoices, for the time period that you have set.

From the `My internal references`{.action} tab, you can edit or deactivate a reference that has already been created by clicking the `...`{.action} to the right of the reference concerned.
