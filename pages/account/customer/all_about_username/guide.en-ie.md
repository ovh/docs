## 
Your username lets you:


- order online.
- identify yourself quickly to customer services so that they can deal with your questions.
- manage all of your services easily with your control panel.


Your username will look something like this:
dm429850-OVH

It is also called a nichandle.


## 
If you do not already have a username, you just have to go to [this page](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie).
You will find an online form. Enter your details, paying special attention to provide a valid email address.

## Advice:
We suggest that you provide an email address that does not use your domain name as well as an emergency email address.
When you have filled out the form you will get an email to confirm that it has been created. Keep your username (nichandle) and password safe.


## In the email which confirms that you have created it
Your username is provided in the confirmation email when you create your account, in emails confirming orders or renewals and when you are notified of connections to your account.


## On your invoices
Your username is provided on all of your invoices, in the top right, with all the useful information.

Once you have got this code, just click "I have received my validation code".
