## Objective

Your customer ID is what you will need to use in order to:

- place orders online
- manage all of your services easily via the OVHcloud Control Panel
- specify your customer account when you contact OVHcloud support, so that they can answer your queries

It is usually made up of two letters, followed by numbers: **xx11111-ovh**.

At OVHcloud, it is known as a NIC handle. 

**This guide explains how to create your NIC handle, log in to your account, manage your personal details and manage access your account.**


## How to create a NIC handle

If you do not have a NIC handle yet, start by creating one on the [OVHcloud login page](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager). 

Fill in the online form, and please ensure you use a **valid email address**.

> [!primary]
>
> Please enter an email address that is not linked to your domain name, as well as a backup email address. The backup email address **must be different from** the primary email address. 
> 

Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email confirming that your account has been created. Please take note of your NIC handle and, as best practice, add your credentials to a password manager. 

To improve security for your account, we recommend:

- reading our guide on [setting and managing an account password](../manage-password/).
- securing access to your account by setting up two-factor authentication. This guide explains how to enable it: [Securing your OVHcloud account with two-factor authentication](../secure-account-with-2FA/).

## How to find your NIC handle

You will always be asked to provide your NIC handle when you log in to your account, and when you contact the OVHcloud support team. There are different ways of finding it.

### In OVHcloud emails

Your NIC handle is included in the account creation confirmation email, order confirmation emails and renewal emails, as well as account login notifications.


### On your bills

Your NIC handle is in the top right-hand corner of all your bills.

### In the Control Panel

You can verify your NIC handle in the OVHcloud Control Panel by clicking your name in the top right-hand corner.

## How to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel

Go to the [OVHcloud login page](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager), and enter your NIC handle and password.

If the [two-factor authentication](../secure-account-with-2FA/) is already active, you will need to complete this procedure as well. This additional layer of security on your account complements your username-password credentials, and is managed via a device you own, e.g. a smartphone, a tablet, or a security key.

> [!primary]
> If you have not set up two-factor authentication on your account, you may be asked to enter a verification code in order to confirm your identity. The verification code is sent to the **primary email address** listed on your account.  
>
> If you cannot find the email containing this code, please check your spam/junk email folders.
>

### What to do if you have forgotten your password

If you have lost or forgotten your password, please follow [this guide detailing the steps to take in order to change it](../manage-password/#if-you-have-forgotten-your-current-password).

### What to do if you cannot access your email address

If you have entered a backup email address, you can contact our [support](https://help.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/) to set your backup email as your primary email address. Once this action has been completed, please ensure that you enter a new backup email address.

If you have not entered a backup email address, or it is also unavailable, please follow [the procedure detailed here](https://www.ovh.ie/cgi-bin/ie/procedure/procedureChangeEmail.cgi). Once this has been processed by our services, we will replace your contact email address if all of the documents provided are valid.

## How to manage your personal details

### Changing your personal details

You can change your account information via the Control Panel. To do this, click on your name in the top right-hand corner of the OVHcloud Control Panel, then click on your initials.

Edit your details, then click `Confirm`{.action} .

> [!warning]
>
> It is highly important to keep your details **up-to-date** and **accurate**. You will be asked to provide your details when you get in touch with the OVHcloud support team, and there may be instances where you are required to provide proof that your details are accurate (such as proof that your address is identical to the address detailed on the account. This may be requested when you follow the email address change procedure).
>

### Changing your primary email address

If you would like to change your primary contact email address, you will need to validate it using a code sent to your current primary contact email address. Once you have received the code, click the “I have received my validation code” button.

### Exercising your personal data rights

In compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you can request to exercise the rights associated with personal data concerning you by using [this form](https://www.ovh.ie/personal-data-protection/exercising-your-rights).

### Deleting your NIC handle

You can request for your NIC handle and all of the data associated with it to be deleted by filling in the [form for exercising GDPR rights](https://www.ovh.ie/personal-data-protection/exercising-your-rights) and selecting “Right of deletion”.

> [!warning]
>
To delete your NIC handle, you will need to meet the following conditions:
>
> - Your account must no longer contain any services.
>
> - Your account must not have any outstanding bills or unpaid orders.
>
>

## Managing access to your account

We advise to never share your account details.

However, you may find that you need to delegate third-party access to your OVHcloud services. The third parties could be members of your company (for example a webmaster or a proxy), or independent entities (for example an accounting firm or IT developers).

In this scenario, OVHcloud enables you to grant access to your account while protecting your credentials (password and two-factor authentication).

### Creating users

A user can have read or write access to your account, or all of your services. You can create, manage and delete these users via the OVHcloud Control Panel. To find out more, please refer to our [guide on user management](../managing-users/).

### Managing contacts

You can delegate admin **or** technical **or** billing management for one or more services on your account to another NIC handle. To find out more, please refer to our [guide on contact management](../managing-contacts/).

## What to do in the event of identity theft

If you receive an email notifying you of an unknown connection to your OVHcloud account, we advise [changing your account password immediately](../manage-password/#change-your-password) and [securing it with two-factor authentication](../secure-account-with-2FA/).

If you observe any suspicious activity on your account, please inform our support team by creating a support request in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/dedicated/#/support/tickets/new).
