## Objective

Two-factor authentication via Universal Second Factor (U2F) is one of the methods offered by OVHcloud to help you secure access to your account. This security technique via USB key is hosted by the FIDO Alliance, and is becoming increasingly popular for two-factor authentication in many domains.

**This guide will show you how to enable two-factor authentication via U2F security key, and understand how to use it in future when you log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- knowledge of the [two-factor authentication methods offered by OVHcloud](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/customer/secure-account-with-2FA/)
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}
- a U2F security key
- a USB port on your computer

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enable two-factor authentication.

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, click your name in the top right-hand corner (1), then click your initials (2). Next, click `Security`{.action} (3) and `Enable two-factor authentication`{.action} (4).

Once the key has been recognised, you can also add a description. This may be useful for identifying people who are likely to use this identification method on your account.

### Step 4: Save the emergency security codes.

When you first add a two-factor authentication security method, you will be sent emergency codes. Please ensure that you store these codes in a safe place. We advise saving them in a password manager.

You can delete or regenerate them via the OVHcloud Control Panel.

> As a reminder, please note that it is important to save these emergency codes and ensure that they are valid. If one of the security methods you have selected becomes unavailable (theft or loss of your mobile phone or security key), access to your account may be blocked.

### Step 5: Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel via two-factor authentication.

Once you have enabled two-factor authentication, the login screen will offer you one of your security methods. If you would like to use another method, click `Try another method`{.action}.
