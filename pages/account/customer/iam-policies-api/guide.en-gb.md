**Last updated 28th February 2023**

## Objective

This guide will explain how it's possible to give specific access rights to users from an OVHcloud account.
The access management of OVHcloud is based on a "policy" management system. It's possible to write different "policies" that give access to users to specific features on the products linked to the OVHcloud account.

In details, a policy contains:

- One or more **identities** targeted by this policy. 
    - It can be account IDs, users or user groups (like the ones used in [federation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/connect-saml-sso/)). 
- One or more **resources** impacted by this policy. 
    - Resource is a product from OVHcloud that will be impacted by this policy (like a domain name, a Nutanix server, a load balancer, etc.).
- One or more **actions** allowed or excepted by this policy. 
    - Actions are the specific rights affected by this policy (rebooting the server, create an email address, terminate a product, etc.)

For instance, we can create a policy to give to a user called John, for a VPS, the access on reboot action.

This guide explains in details how theses policies can be declared using the OVHcloud API, and how to list the identities, resources and actions available for them.

## Requirements

Here are the requirements for setting up a policy:

- An [OVHcloud account](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/create-ovhcloud-account/)
- To know [how to manage account users](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-users/)
- Some OVHcloud products linked to this OVHcloud account (Load balancer, Domain, VPS, ...)

## Instructions

### Policies

This first part describes how to create and update policies.

Resources, resource groups and actions needed to create a policy will be described in next sections.

#### API definition

<https://api.ovh.com/console-preview/?section=%2Fiam&branch=v2#get-/iam/policy>

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/iam/policy|Retrieve all policies|
|POST|/iam/policy|Create a new policy|
|GET|/iam/policy/{policyId}|Retrieve the given policy|
|PUT|/iam/policy/{policyId}|Update an existing policy|
|DELETE|/iam/policy/{policyId}|Delete the given policy|

#### Retrieve all policies

First, let's see how a policy is built.

Find all policies, including those pre-generated by OVH, by calling the API: **/iam/policy**

*Example output:*

**/iam/policy**

```json
[
    {
        "id": "69470db1-5372-4e32-acf1-edc2afd84c12",
        "owner": "xx1111-ovh",
        "name": "ovh-default",
        "readOnly": true,
        "identities": [
            "urn:v1:eu:identity:account:xx1111-ovh"
        ],
        "resources": [
            {
                "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resourceGroup:aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8"
            }
        ],
        "permissions": {
            "allow": [
                {
                    "action": "*"
                }
            ]
        },
        "createdAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z",
        "updatedAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z"
    }
]
```

In this example, the account "*urn:v1:eu:identity:account:xx1111-ovh*" can do every action (*"action":"\*"*) to the group of resources "*urn:v1:eu:resourceGroup:aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8*". This policy is owned by "*xx1111-ovh*" (it corresponds to the admin role, it is created by OVHcloud and cannot be modified).

Every items in policies are defined by URNs. These URNs are defined by the following pattern:

||**urn**|**:**|**version**|**:**|**plate**|**:**|**type**|**:**|**sub-type**|**:**|**id**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|**Description**|immutable prefix|:|version of the IAM system|:|Plate where the urn is located|:|Type of the current urn|:|(optional) Sub-type for **identity** or **resource** type|:|Unique identifier associated to the urn|
|**Possible values**|urn|:|v1|:|eu, ca, us|:|identity, resource, resourceGroup|:|<p>For **identity** type: account, user, group</p><p>For **resource** type: any resourceType</p>|:|Alphanumerical value|
|**Account ID Example**|urn|:|v1|:|eu|:|identity|:|account|:|xx1111-ovh|
|**User group Example**|urn|:|v1|:|eu|;|identity|:|group|:|xx1111-ovh/admin@mycompany.com|
|**VPS Example**|urn|:|v1|:|ca|:|resource|:|vps|:|b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93|
|**Resource Group Example**|urn|:|v1|:|us|:|resourceGroup|||:|aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8|

##### **Policy attributes**

- id: Unique identifier of the policy. It follows the UUID format
- owner: The account that created this policy
- name: The policy name. It's possible to use this name to organize the policies. There is no format to follow (except that the prefix "ovh-" is reserved for OVHcloud policies).
- readOnly: If true, it indicates that the policy cannot be edited. It often represents policies managed by OVHcloud
- identities: The identities concerned by the policy. They are specified by a URN. **account:<account-id>** for the account, **user:<account-id>/<username>** for an account user, **group:<account-id>/<username>** for a user group
- resources: The resources concerned by the policy. They are specified by a URN. **resource** for a resource, **resourceGroup** for a resource group
- permissions: Can be **allow** or **except**: 
  - allow: Array of actions allowed for the identities regarding the resources. All actions are denied by default
  - except: Extension of the **allow** parameter. Array of actions not to allow even though they are included in the **allow** actions. For instance, this is useful when there is a wildcard allow action but it's necessary to exclude a specific action that otherwise would be included in the wildcard.
- createdAt: Creation date of the policy
- updateAt: Last update date of the policy

#### Create a policy

Create a new policy using this API:

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|POST|/iam/policy|Create a new policy|
For example, create a policy to authorize a user named "*user1*" to do some actions on a VPS:

**create policy example**

```json
{
    "description": "VPS - reboot and create snapshot",
    "identities": [
        "urn:v1:eu:identity:user:xx1111-ovh/user1"
    ],
    "name": "vps-reboot-snapshot",
    "permissions": {
        "allow": [
            {
                "action": "vps:apiovh:reboot"
            },
            {
                "action": "vps:apiovh:createSnapshot"
            }
        ]
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:vps:b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93"
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy is not for an account but for a user, so the identity URN corresponds to the format "*urn:v1:eu:identity:**user**:<nic-handle>/**<username>***".

With this JSON as body for the POST /iam/policy call, the policy will be created.

Check it via GET /iam/policy:

**GET /iam/policies**

```json
[
    {
        "id": "69470db1-5372-4e32-acf1-edc2afd84c12",
        "owner": "xx1111-ovh",
        "name": "ovh-default",
        "readOnly": true,
        "identities": [
            "urn:v1:eu:identity:account:xx1111-ovh"
        ],
        "resources": [
            {
                "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resourceGroup:aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8"
            }
        ],
        "permissions": {
            "allow": [
                {
                    "action": "*"
                }
            ]
        },
        "createdAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z",
        "updatedAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z"
    },
    {
        "id": "9dfe6a03-1937-4287-8ab7-866224d333b1",
        "owner": "xx1111-ovh",
        "name": "vps-reboot-snapshot",
        "readOnly": false,
        "description": "VPS - reboot and create snapshot",
        "identities": [
            "urn:v1:eu:identity:user:xx1111-ovh/user1"
        ],
        "resources": [
            {
                "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:vps:b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93"
            }
        ],
        "permissions": {
            "allow": [
                {
                    "action": "vps:apiovh:reboot"
                },
                {
                    "action": "vps:apiovh:createSnapshot"
                }
            ]
        },
        "createdAt": "2023-02-07T15:24:57.680037Z"
    }
]
```

The policy has successfully been created. Now, "***user1***" can **reboot and create a snapshot** on the VPS "***urn:v1:eu:resource:vps:b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93***".

### Identities

Policies apply to users, which can be Accounts, users or user groups.

This section describes how to retrieve or create user for the policy

#### API definition

<https://api.ovh.com/console-preview/?section=%2Fme&branch=v1#overview>

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/me/identity/user|Retrieve all users of this account|
|POST|/me/identity/user|Create a new user|

#### Create users

List all the current users related to the account by calling **/me/identity/user**,

**/me/identity/user**

```json
[
  "user1",
  "user2",
]
```

These users can be used on policies with the URN format: urn:v1:eu:identity:user:**xx1111-ovh**/**user1**

To create a new user, call the API with the following body:

**post /me/identity/user**

```json
{
  "description": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "group": "string",
  "login": "string",
  "password": ""
}
```

#### Create user groups

List all the current user groups related to the account by calling **/me/identity/group**

**/me/identity/group**

```json
[
  "ADMIN",
  "DEFAULT",
  "UNPRIVILEGED",
  "admin@mycompany.com"
]
```

These user groups can be used on policies with the URN format: urn:v1:eu:identity:group:**xx1111-ovh**/**admin@mycompany.com**

To create a new user group, call the API with the following body:

**post /me/identity/group**

```json
{
  "description": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "role": "REGULAR"
}
```

For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-users/) for user management.

#### With SSO connection enabled

If the federation is enabled through the [SSO connection](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/connect-saml-sso/), policies only apply to user groups as described in the previous section.

### Resources

Policies refer to **resources.** The resources are the OVHcloud products subscribed by the OVHcloud account and that can be controlled by this account.

This section describes how to retrieve resources information to use in a policy.

#### API definition

<https://api.ovh.com/console-preview/?section=%2Fiam&branch=v2#get-/iam/resource>

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/iam/resource|List all resources|
|GET|/iam/resource/{resourceId}|Retrieve a resource|

#### Example

See all the resources linked to the OVHcloud account by calling **/iam/resource/**

**/iam/resource**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93",
    "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:vps:b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93",
    "name": "vps-5b48d78b.vps.ovh.net",
    "displayName": "vps-5b48d78b.vps.ovh.net",
    "type": "vps",
    "owner": "xx1111-ovh"
  },
  {
    "id": "c24ace5e-6c9c-436b-9a73-515db8df6250",
    "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:emailDomain:c24ace5e-6c9c-436b-9a73-515db8df6250",
    "name": "acme.com",
    "displayName": "acme.com",
    "type": "emailDomain",
    "owner": "xx1111-ovh"
  },
  {
    "id": "8d70a49b-7a8b-4ec0-ad4b-756da802d994",
    "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:cdn:8d70a49b-7a8b-4ec0-ad4b-756da802d994",
    "name": "cdn-46.105.198.89-12969",
    "displayName": "cdn-46.105.198.89-12969",
    "type": "cdn",
    "owner": "xx1111-ovh"
  }
]
```

In this exemple, this account has 3 resources available (a VPS, an email domain and a CDN). Each of this resources has a set of attributes to identify them on policies.

#### Resource attributes

- id: Unique identifier of the resource. It follows the UUID format
- urn: Resource URN
- name: The resource name
- displayName: The resource name as displayed in the user interface
- type: The resource type (vps, publiccloud, dnsZone, domain, emailDomain, ...)
- owner: The resource owner (NIC Handle)

### Resource Groups

To ease the policy management for large number of resources, it's possible to set up a resource group which aggregates several resources to a unique URN

#### API definition

<https://api.ovh.com/console-preview/?section=%2Fiam&branch=v2#get-/iam/resourceGroup>

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/iam/resourceGroup|Retrieve all resource groups|
|POST|/iam/resourceGroup|Create a new resource group|
|GET|/iam/resourceGroup/{groupId}|Retrieve the given resource group|
|PUT|/iam/resourceGroup/{groupId}|Update an existing resource group|
|DELETE|/iam/resourceGroup/{groupId}|Delete the given resource group|

#### Retrieve a resource group

List all resource groups by calling **/iam/resourceGroup**

This API can be called with a query-string parameters "details" to expand the results with all the attributes of the returned resources.

*Example output:*

**/iam/resourceGroup**

```json
[
    {
        "id": "aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8",
        "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resourceGroup:aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8",
        "readOnly": true,
        "name": "myVPS",
        "owner": "xx1111-ovh",
        "resources": [
            {
                "id": "b96ffed4-3467-4129-b8be-39a3eb3a0a93"
            },
            {
                "id": "7a19dbca-7da5-460f-a59b-69d56e57bf9d"
            },
            {
                "id": "50423397-8984-4d44-8505-fdd489c2c9fb"
            }
        ],
        "updatedAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z",
        "createdAt": "2023-01-27T11:29:22.197537Z"
    }
]
```

In the example, we can see that this resource group "*urn:v1:eu:resourceGroup:aa0713ab-ed13-4f1a-89a5-32aa0cb936d8*" has 3 resources. It means that a policy applied to this resource group will be applied on those 3 resources.

##### **Resource group attributes**

- id: Unique identifier of the resource group. It follows the UUID format.
- urn: Resource group URN to use on the policy
- readOnly: Cannot be modified if it's true. The default resource groups are read-only
- name: The resource group name
- owner: The resource group owner (NIC Handle)
- resources: 
  - If details = false: Array of resources UUID
  - If details = true: The resources will be expanded with their attributes (as the result we have via the resource API)
- createdAt: Creation date of the resource group
- updateAt: Last update date of the resource group

#### Create a resource group

Create a resource group with this API:

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|POST|/iam/resourceGroup|Create a new resource group|
The following example creates a resource group called "*Test\_Envrionment*" containing two resources:

Error rendering macro 'code': Invalid value specified for parameter 'com.atlassian.confluence.ext.code.render.InvalidValueException' 

```json
{
  "name": "Test_environment",
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "b10611a9-7cc1-40b7-8475-18aabcdffc62"
    },
    {
      "id": "53f815b1-c020-4e5d-8239-fbbcaaca1742"
    }
  ]
}

```

### Action

Policies contain a list of **Action** that will be allowed or denied to users

Theses actions are specific to every product, such as rebooting a database, ordering an upgrade, restoring a snapshot, etc.

#### API definition

<https://api.ovh.com/console-preview/?section=%2Fiam&branch=v2#get-/iam/reference/action>

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/iam/reference/action|Retrieve all actions|

##### **Example**

List all the actions available for policies with the API.

Here's an example:

**action example**

```json
{
    "action": "vps:apiovh:reboot",
    "description": "Request a reboot of the machine",
    "resourceType": "vps",
    "categories": [
        "OPERATE"
    ]
}
```

This action is "*vps:apiovh:reboot*", it targets the ability to reboot a VPS.

The call to /iam/reference/action API will list **all of the available** actions (WARNING: this contains a huge amount of items).

It's strongly recommended to specify the **resourceType** as a query-string parameter for this API (see the next section).

#### Action attributes

- action: The action itself
- description: The action description
- resourceType: The resource type targeted by this action
- categories: The categories of this action (CREATE, READ, EDIT, OPERATE, DELETE)

#### Resource types

##### **API definition**

|**Method**|**Path**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|GET|/iam/reference/resource/type|Retrieve all resource types|

##### **Example**

Here's a part of the output:

**/iam/reference/resource/type**

```json
[
    "account",
    "packXdsl",
    "cloudDB",
    "loadbalancer",
    "mxplanAccount",
    "publicCloud",
    "voipSmsvn",
    "vps",
    ...
]
```
