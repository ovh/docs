### Step 3: Confirm two-factor authentication.

Scan the QR code via your OTP application. In the field to the right of the QR code, enter the code given by the application. You can also add a description of this authentication method. This may be useful if you want to identify the people able to use this method on your account.

### Step 4: Save the emergency security codes.

When you first add a two-factor authentication security method, you will be sent emergency codes, which need to be stored in a safe place. We recommend saving them in a password manager.

You can delete or regenerate them via the OVHcloud Control Panel:

> As a reminder, please note that it is important to save these emergency codes and ensure that they are valid. If one of the security methods you have selected becomes unavailable (theft or loss of your mobile phone or security key), access to your account may be blocked.

### Step 5: Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel via two-factor authentication.

Once you have enabled two-factor authentication, the login screen will offer you one of your security methods. If you would like to use another method, click `Try another method`{.action}.
