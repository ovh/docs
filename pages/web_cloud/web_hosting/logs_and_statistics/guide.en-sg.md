### User administration <a name="admin-user"></a>

Creating a user will allow someone to access your web hosting plan’s statistics without having access to the OVHcloud Control Panel.

In the `User administration`{.action} section, click `Create a new user`{.action} , then follow the instructions to finish creating a new user.

```bash
https://logs.cluster000.hosting.ovh.net/domain.tld/
```
