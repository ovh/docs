> If you encounter any difficulties by following any of the steps described below, please refer to our specific documentation on [the most common errors related to 1-click modules](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/diagnostic_errors_module1clic). 
>

### Step 1: Decide on a CMS to use

With a CMS, you can build a website via an easy-to-use interface. Several types of CMS exist, some are designed to create an e-commerce website, others to set up a showcase website, a blog, etc. You can then configure a ready-to-use, customisable website structure (themes, extensions, text, etc.) to suit your needs.

Of all CMSs, OVHcloud offers 4 with its 1-click modules, which can be installed automatically. 

Using this solution, you will need to choose from the 4 CMSs listed above. If you have already made your choice, continue reading the steps in this guide. Otherwise, please refer to our [CMS comparison](/links/web/hosting-cms-comparison) to make your choice.

If you would like to install a CMS that is not available as a 1-click modules, you can install it manually on your web hosting plan. This is provided that the CMS is compatible with our [OVHcloud web hosting offers](/links/web/hosting).

### Step 2: Access the 1-click module manager

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and select `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. Click `Hosting plans`{.action}, then choose the web hosting plan you would like to install a 1-click module on. Then click the `1-click modules`{.action} tab.

You will find any 1-click modules already installed. You can manage your 1-click modules and install new ones.

### Step 3: Add a 1-click module

In the `1-click modules`{.action} tab of your hosting, click on the `Add a module`{.action} button.

In the window that pops up, choose the CMS you want to use, then select the domain name you want to set up your website with:

![Choose a module](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/web-hosting/1-click-modules/add-a-module-select-module-and-domain.png){.thumbnail}

If your domain is not in the list, go to the `Multisite`{.action} tab to add it. See our guide [Hosting multiple websites on your web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_configure_multisite){.external} if required.

> [!primary]
>
> Below the form for selecting a domain name (or subdomain), verify that the default `Installation path` is the one in which you want to install your 1-click module.
>
> As a reminder, this directory must be completely empty.
>
> If you need assistance, please refer to our guide on [Hosting multiple websites on your web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_configure_multisite) to modify your domain name’s target directory.
>

Once your domain has been correctly added, try adding a 1-click module again.

Once you have selected a CMS, choose between a **fast** or **advanced** installation:

- **Quick** installation (selected by default): OVHcloud installs the CMS, and provides you with your admin credentials via email on the OVHcloud contact email address. This is the easiest and fastest way to install a 1-click module.
- **Advanced** installation: It allows you to customise the configuration for the CMS installation. You will need to enter all of the information required for the CMS to work properly: 
    - Login information for your database (server, username, port, password, etc.)
    - Installation path in your web hosting plan’s FTP storage space
    - CMS language
    - Administrator credentials (administrator name, password, email address, etc.)

#### Quick installation of a 1-click module

Choose the domain name for your CMS, verify the target directory that will appear automatically after you have chosen your domain name, then check that the `Installation in advanced mode`{.action} box has not been ticked. Then click the `Install`{.action} button.

> [!warning]
>
> The installation directory for your 1-click module must be empty, and you must have at least one database available to create on your OVHcloud web hosting plan for the installation to be carried out.
>
> For a quick installation, do not create the database beforehand because the installation robot will take care of it.
>

![Basic module installation](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/web-hosting/1-click-modules/add-a-module-quick-mod-step-1-b.png){.thumbnail}

Once the installation is complete, you will receive an email containing the login details for your CMS administrator interface (back office). Log in to the interface to customise your website.

> [!primary]
>
> It may take up to 15 minutes for the module to be installed after you click the `Install`{.action} button in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
>

#### Advanced installation of a 1-click module

To perform this installation method, ensure that the `Installation in advanced mode`{.action} box is ticked, then click `Next`{.action}:

![Database for advanced installation](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/web-hosting/1-click-modules/add-a-module-advanced-mod-step-3.png){.thumbnail}

There are several possibilities:

- The database has already been created on your web hosting plan: Select it from the `Select the database`{.action} dropdown menu, then enter the information requested.
- The database has not yet been created on your web hosting plan: [Create your database included with your web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_create_database), go back to the `Select the database`{.action} drop-down menu and enter the information requested.
- The database is [created on your Web Cloud Databases instance](/pages/web_cloud/web_cloud_databases/create-db-and-user-on-db-server): In the `Select the database`{.action} dropdown menu, select `Database aside from your web hosting`{.action} and enter the requested information. The instance and web hosting plan must be hosted in the same data centre.
- The database is created on another OVHcloud web hosting plan: In the `Select the database`{.action} drop-down menu, select `Database aside from your web hosting`{.action} and enter the requested information. The database and web hosting plan must be hosted in the same data centre.

The remaining information requested for the database is as follows:

- *Server address*: Enter the name of your database server, included in the installation email and displayed in your OVHcloud Control Panel. 

> [!primary]
> 
> - The server name of a database included with your web hosting plan usually has this form: `NameOfYourDatabase.mysql.db`. 
>
> - The server name of a Cloud Web Databases database starts with your OVHcloud NIC handle and is in the following form: `OVHID(without-ovh)-XXX.eu.clouddb.ovh.net` where the **"X"** are to be replaced by the reference of your Cloud Databases web service.
>

- *Database name*: this name was defined when the database was created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

- *Port*: Use the number **3306** (the default port) for a database included with your web hosting plan. For a database on a Cloud Web Databases instance, see [this guide](/pages/web_cloud/web_cloud_databases/starting_with_clouddb).

- *User name*: It is identical to the database name if you are using a database included with your web hosting plan. For databases created on a Web Cloud Databases solution, please refer to the information in [this guide](/pages/web_cloud/web_cloud_databases/starting_with_clouddb).

- *Password*: It was sent to you by email when the database was created. You may have modified it in the meantime.

Once you have entered this information, click `Next`{.action}.

##### Configure the module

Enter the following information for the module configuration:

- *Admin name or email address:* The username you will use to log in to your CMS administration interface (back office).
- *Password:* The password you use to log in to your CMS admin interface.

>
> Check that the `Installation path` contains the directory where you want to install your 1-click module with your domain name.
>
> As a reminder, this directory must be completely empty.
>
> In addition, if you enter a subdirectory in the `Installation path` field, it will appear in the URL used to access your 1-click module.
> For example, if you enter the subdirectory *test*, the URL to access the 1-click module will look like this: **http://domain.tld/test/**.
>
> If you need assistance, please refer to our guide on [Hosting multiple websites on your web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_configure_multisite) to modify your domain name’s target directory.
