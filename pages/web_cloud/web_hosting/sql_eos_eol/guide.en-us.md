If you want to anticipate this end of sale/life or perform the actions manually, you must perform the following actions:

- Case 1: You only have one database included with your Web Hosting plan:
    - Verify that the database contents are compatible with a newer DBMS.
    - [Export the database content](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_database_export).
    - Delete the old database.
    - [Create a new database](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_create_database) in a newer DBMS version.
    - [Import the content from the old database into the new one](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_importing_mysql_database).
    - Link the new database to your website.

- Case 2: You have several databases included with your Web Hosting plan:
    - Verify that the database contents are compatible with a newer DBMS.
    - As a precaution, [export database content](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_database_export).
    - [Create a new database](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/sql_create_database) in a newer DBMS version.
    - [Duplicate the content of the old database into the new one](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/copy_database).
    - Link the new database to your website.
    - Delete the old database.
