## Objective

Several error returns may appear on your browser if your website becomes inaccessible. The examples below show an incorrect configuration of your [DNS servers](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_server_edit), your [DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit) or a suspended domain (if your website does not display one of the error messages described here, see the [Go further](#go-further) section):

|Browser|Error Message|
|-|---|
|Chrome:<br>"This site can't be reached"|![cantbereached_chrome](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/errors/cant-be-reached-chrome.png){.thumbnail}|
|Firefox:<br>"Hmm. We're having trouble finding that site."|![cantbereached_firefox](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/errors/cant-be-reached-firefox.png){.thumbnail}|
|Edge:<br>"Hmmm... can't reach this page"|![cantbereached_edge](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/errors/cant-be-reached-edge.png){.thumbnail}|
|Safari:<br>"Safari Can't Find the Server"|![cantbereached_safari](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/errors/cant-be-reached-safari.png){.thumbnail}|

## Requirements

- Administrative access to your domain name in order to change the DNS servers and edit the [DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- No outstanding [payments](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/invoice_management#pay-bills) and [renewals](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal#renewal-management) of related services (domain name and web hosting plan)

## Instructions

### Step 1: check the validity of your domain name subscription

> [!warning]
>
> You are solely responsible for renewing your web services.<br>
> As a hosting provider, OVHcloud is required to permanently delete any web services (domains, hosting plans, e-mails, etc.) that have not been renewed in time, as well as all of the data they store.
>
> As a result, we strongly recommend that you enable [automatic renewal](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal#instructions) for all of your OVHcloud subscriptions.
>

To check that your domain name subscription is valid, click on your name at the top right-hand corner of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), then click on `Products and services`{.action} within the right-hand menu.

![control-panel](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/right-column/right-menu-product-and-services.png){.thumbnail}|

Renew your domain if necessary with the `...`{.action} button, then click on `Renew service`{.action}.

![renew-service-button](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/order/renew-service-button.png){.thumbnail}

After the renewal of your offer is completed, your website will be available within a maximum of 48 hours.

### Step 2: check the DNS servers

To check that your [DNS servers](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_server_edit) are valid, click on `Domain names`{.action} in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), then on your domain name.

#### Scenario 1: no anomalies appear on the DNS servers

Check the servers listed in the `DNS servers`{.action} tab:

![srv-dns-ok2](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-servers/name-dns-server.png){.thumbnail}

If they are identical to the targets of the `NS` type entries in the `DNS zone`{.action}, go to [step 3](#step3):

![srv-dns-ok](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/dashboard-entry-ns.png){.thumbnail}

#### Scenario 2: a warning appears above the DNS zone

A warning in the `DNS zone`{.action} tab indicates that the DNS servers used by your domain name are not the ones indicated in your [DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit). Two scenarios are possible:

- Under the sentence "You are currently using the following DNS servers", the servers listed are "ns **?** .ovh.net" and "dns **?** .ovh.net" (replace the "**?**" by any number):

![warning_other_ovh_dns_srv](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/message-other-ovh-dns-servers.png){.thumbnail}

Modify the DNS servers as described in [this guide](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_server_edit), so that they are identical to the targets of the `NS` type records in your `DNS zone`{.action}.

Your website will then be available within a maximum of 48 hours.

- Under the sentence "You are currently using the following DNS servers", the servers listed are not "ns **?** .ovh.net" and "dns **?** .ovh.net".

![warning_external_dns_srv](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/message-external-dns-servers.png){.thumbnail}

> [!warning]
>
> In this situation, please contact your DNS Zone provider, your webmaster or a [OVHcloud partner](/links/partner) before making any changes.
>
> The DNS servers used by your domain name may be functional and the problem accessing your website be linked to a missing or incorrect entry in the active [DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_general_information). Changing the DNS servers in this situation might make your e-mail addresses or other online applications related to your domain name unavailable.
>

#### Scenario 3: no NS-type entries appear in the DNS zone

Your domain’s `DNS zone`{.action} does not contain any `NS` record:

![srv_dns_missing](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/dashboard-entry-ns-missing.png){.thumbnail}

Back up the current zone by clicking on the `Change in text format`{.action} button:

![change_DNS_zone_change_text_format](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/change-in-text-format.png){.thumbnail}

Then copy and paste the content of your `DNS zone`{.action} into a text document on your computer.

Then click on `Reset my DNS zone`{.action} and select `No, but I want to reset my DNS zone`{.action}. Select your e-mail and hosting servers and click on `Confirm`{.action}.

![change_DNS_zone_reset](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/reset-my-dns-zone.png){.thumbnail}

Your website will then be available again within a maximum of 24 hours.

### Step 3: check the DNS zone <a name="step3"></a>

In this step, you will find your hosting plan’s IP address, then add it to your `DNS zone`{.action}.

If your site is not hosted on the OVHcloud infrastructure or is managed by another provider, please contact the concerned support service.

If your site is hosted on one of our [Cloud web offers](/links/web/hosting), click on the `Hosting plans`{.action} tab and choose the web hosting offer which contains your website.

In the `General information`{.action} tab, copy the IPV4 and/or IPV6 address of your domain name.

![find-ipv4-and-ipv6](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/web-hosting/general-information/find-ipv4-and-ipv6.png){.thumbnail}

Then refer to it in your domain’s [DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit), by modifying or creating one or more `A` entries.

![ipv4-DNSzone](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/domain-dns/dns-zone/dashboard-entry-a.png){.thumbnail}

Your website will then be available within a maximum of 24 hours.
