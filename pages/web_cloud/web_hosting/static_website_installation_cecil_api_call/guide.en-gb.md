title: "Tutorial - Add dynamic content to a static web page generated with Cecil"
excerpt: "Find out how to add a call to an external API from your static web page"

## Objective

This tutorial describes how to use the [Cecil](https://cecil.app){.external} site builder to display the contents of a dynamic page. All this while calling an API to retrieve and display information on a page generated via **Cecil**.

**Find out how to add a call to an external API from your static web page.**

## Requirements

- Have an [OVHcloud web hosting plan](/links/web/hosting) that includes SSH access. With this access, you can install one or more alternative solutions online, to those offered by default in our web hosting plans.
- Be familiar with command line input.
- You need to have installed and configured the **Cecil** application on your web hosting plan (see our tutorial on [installing and configuring Cecil](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/static_website_installation_cecil)).

## Instructions

The chosen example is to use one of the APIs of a service providing meteorological data. It relies on a city entered by the user.

The steps are as follows:

- Create a new page on Cecil and add this page to the website menu.
- Create an account and retrieve the key for making requests to the weather API.
- Modify the `.md` file created by adding HTML code.
- Add `assets` (JavaScript and CSS).
- Build and test the solution.

### Create a new page

Prepare your environment by logging in via SSH to your web hosting plan, and refer to the tutorial “[Installation and configuration of Cecil](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/static_website_installation_cecil)” to install your **Cecil** application in a dedicated directory.

Create a directory and switch to it:

```bash
mkdir myWebSite
cd myWebSite
```

### Using the OpenWeather API

For this tutorial, we will use an API provided by the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/){.external} website. It allows to retrieve weather information based on the name of a city.

Create an account on <https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up>.<br>
Once your account has been validated (by sending a confirmation email), go to the “My API keys” menu. A key was generated by default, retrieve it and save it for the rest of this tutorial.

### Add HTML

Create a new page with the following command:

```bash
php cecil.phar new:page weather.md
```

Then edit the page that you generate:

```bash
nano pages/weather.md
```

Change the file header so that the page appears in the menu:

```
---
title: "Weather"
date: 2022-11-28
published: true
menu: hand
---
```

After the header, add the HTML code to display the chosen city, the temperatures returned by the API and a button to change the parameter:

```html
---
title: "Weather"
date: 2022-11-28
published: true
menu: hand
---
<h1>Weather</h1>
<div>
    <span id="city">Roubaix</span>
    <div id="temperature"><span id="temperatureValue"></span> °C</div>
    <div id="modify">Change city</div>
</div>
```

Generate the HTML page with the following command:

```bash
php cecil.phar build
```

Check the result in your browser and click the "Weather" link that was added to the main menu:

### Add JavaScript

You cannot add a `<script>` tag to a Markdown file. You will need to modify the template provided by default.

#### Modify the template

Templates are arranged in the `layouts` directory. You can view them with the following command:

```bash
ls -la layouts
```

The file contains a `blog` directory and an `index.html.twig` file:

![layouts directory](/pages/assets/screens/other/web-tools/terminal/static_website_installation_cecil_api_call03.png){.thumbnail}

Open the file `index.html.twig`:

![Cecil layouts index file](/pages/assets/screens/other/web-tools/terminal/static_website_installation_cecil_api_call04.png){.thumbnail}

The file references a template that is not present in the directory. This file (and others) are actually inside `cecil.phar`. Files with the `.phar` extension are PHP file archives that can be manipulated without being decompressed.
Unzip the files in this archive to make them visible:

```bash
php cecil.phar util:extract
```

Display the contents of the `layouts` directory again:

![Cecil layouts directory including uncompressed files](/pages/assets/screens/other/web-tools/terminal/static_website_installation_cecil_api_call05.png){.thumbnail}

Modify the default template to insert a `<script>` tag that will contain the code to call the API:

```bash
nano layouts/_default/page.html.twig
```

This tag and its contents must be placed before the closing tag `</body>` at the bottom of the page:

```twig
    </footer>
    {%- include 'partials/googleanalytics.js.twig' with {site} only ~%}
    {% block javascript %}
    <script src="{{ asset('script.js', {minify: true}) }}"></script>
    {% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
```

When one or more `asset` files are modified, rebuild the cache with the following command:

```bash
php cecil.phar cache:clear:assets
```

If the modifications are not displayed in your web browser, clear the cache.
You can also delete the files generated on your Web Hosting plan:

```bash
php cecil.phar clear
```

Then rebuild your solution using the command below:

```bash
php cecil.phar build
```

#### Add JavaScript

JavaScript files, such as CSS files, must be placed in the `assets` directory. You can organise them in different directories.

Create the previously mentioned `script.js` file at the root of the `assets` directory:

```bash
nano assets/script.js
```

Replace the value of the `apiKey` variable with the key retrieved earlier on the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/){.external} site.

```javascript
let apiKey = '123456789'; // Replace this value
let city = 'Roubaix'; // Indicate here the default city that will be displayed on the weather page
getTemperature(city);  // Call function calling the API with the parameter "city"

// Add an event by clicking on the “Change city” button
let button = document.querySelector('#modify');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    city = prompt('Choose a city');
    getTemperature(city);
});

// API call function using an XMLHttpRequest object for asynchronous request
function getTemperature(city) {
    let url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=' + city + '&appid=' + apiKey + '&units=metric';
    let xhrQuery = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhrQuery.open('GET', url);
    xhrQuery.responseType = 'json';
    xhrQuery.send();

    xhrQuery.onload = function() {
        if (xhrQuery.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
            if (xhrQuery.status === 200) {
                let city = xhrQuery.response.name;
                let temperature = xhrQuery.response.main.temp;
                document.querySelector('#city').textContent = city;
                document.querySelector('#temperatureValue').textContent = temperature;
            } else
                alert('A problem has occurred, please try later.');
            }
        }
    };
}
```

### Tests

Now visit your website in a web browser:

![Web page with JavaScript running](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/web-pages/static_website_installation_cecil_api_call06.png){.thumbnail}

Click on “Change city” and enter the name of a municipality:

![Select a new city](/pages/assets/screens/other/browsers/web-pages/static_website_installation_cecil_api_call07.png){.thumbnail}

### Conclusion

This tutorial shows you an example of how to integrate dynamic data retrieved from external sources using APIs. Build and maintain a website by manually editing the content of these pages, or create new ones. All this while enriching their content from other websites.
