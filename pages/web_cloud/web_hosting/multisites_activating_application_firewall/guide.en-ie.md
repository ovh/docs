## Objective

*ModSecurity* is a complementary Apache module that filters all incoming requests on your web server. It increases security against known vulnerabilities by intercepting and filtering requests before they are processed by any scripts. 

The preconfigured Core Rule Set (CRS) of our *ModSecurity* protects your websites against the most common attacks, for example:

- Trojans
- Email injections
- Broken PDF files
- File injections on your hosting system
- SQL or XSS type injections

**This guide explains how to enable your application firewall for enhanced protection in your OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](/links/web/hosting){.external}
- at least one [domain name](/links/web/domains){.external} attached to the hosting
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and switch to `Web Cloud`{.action}. 
Click on `Hosting Plans`{.action} and select the plan concerned.

Tasks to update your Multisite configuration will be listed in the `Ongoing jobs`{.action} tab (initial status is `Planned`). The firewall will be active once its update task no longer appears in the list.

### Verifying which domains have the firewall enabled

The `Multisite`{.action} tab of your hosting plan provides information on which domains have the firewall option turned on.
