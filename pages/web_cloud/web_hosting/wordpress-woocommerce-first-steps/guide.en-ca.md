## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud web hosting plan](/links/web/hosting)  that contains at least one database
- A [domain name](/links/web/domains).
- [WordPress installed](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/cms_install_1_click_modules) on your web hosting plan

If one is not already installed, [add an SSL certificate](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl-activate-https-website#step-1-activate-the-ssl-certificate-on-the-web-hosting-plan) for the domain name associated with your website before you continue.
  
## Instructions
  
**WooCommerce** is an extension for **WordPress** and can be installed like any other plugin.

### Installation

Log in to your admin interface by typing `/wp-admin` or `/wp-login` in your address bar after your domain name URL (redirection is done automatically):

![Admin page of WordPress](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/admin-login.png){.thumbnail}

In the left-hand menu, go to `Plugins`{.action} then click on `Add New`{.action}:

![Dashboard, Plugins, Add new](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/plugins.png){.thumbnail}

On the new `Add Plugins` page, type "woocommerce" in the search bar in the top right and click `Install Now`{.action} in the **WooCommerce** box:

![Install WooCommerce](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/add-plugin-woocommerce-install-now.png){.thumbnail}

Now click on `Activate`{.action}:

![Activate WooCommerce](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/add-plugin-woocommerce-activate.png){.thumbnail}

### Configuration 

#### Method 1: Using the configuration wizard

If you have not yet set up your **WooCommerce** plugin, a setup wizard will help you fill in the information for your online store. Fill in the form and click `Continue`{.action}:

![Setup Wizard - Store Details](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-store-details.png){.thumbnail}

Then select your business domain(s):

![Setup Wizard - Industry](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-industry.png){.thumbnail}

Choose the type of products you want to sell on your website (some options are not free):

![Setup Wizard - Product Types](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-product-types.png){.thumbnail}

Then enter the nature of your activity:

![Setup Wizard - Business Details](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-business-details.png){.thumbnail}

Add optional (and free) features if you want:

![Setup Wizard - Business Details, free features](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-business-details-2.png){.thumbnail}

Finally, choose a theme from the list:

![Setup Wizard - Choose a theme](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/woocommerce-theme.png){.thumbnail}

**WooCommerce** then prompts you to create an account to use the **Jetpack** plugin, which is automatically installed in addition to **WooCommerce**. This account creation is optional, you will have access to the limited functions of **Jetpack** without having to authenticate.

Your online store is now configured with the general settings.

#### Method 2: Manual configuration

Click `Plugins`{.action} to list the installed extensions and then click `Installed plugins`. You will see a list of your plugins. Click `Settings`{.action} in the **WooCommerce** module:

![Setup Wizard - Extension, WooCommerce, Settings](/pages/assets/screens/other/cms/wordpress/woocommerce/plugins-woocommerce.png){.thumbnail}

You can also access these settings by clicking directly on `WooCommerce`{.action}, then `Settings`{.action}:
