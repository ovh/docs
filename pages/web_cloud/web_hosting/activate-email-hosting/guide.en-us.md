## Objective

If you have ordered a Web Hosting plan without directly linking it to a domain name, the email solution included with your Web Hosting plan must be enabled manually. You can link it to the domain name of your choice.

**Find out how to activate the email addresses included in your Web Hosting plan.**

## Requirements

- a [domain name](/links/web/domains){.external} registered with OVHcloud
- an [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](/links/web/hosting)
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) with the necessary permissions to manage the Web Hosting plan

> [!warning]
>
> If your domain name is already registered with OVHcloud, or if a DNS zone already exists for it in another [OVHcloud account](/links/manager) than your own, please read our documentation “[Managing your service contacts](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts)” to find out how to manage it.
>
> Finally, if your domain name is already linked to the "email address(es) included with your web hosting plan" option on another web hosting plan, you cannot link it to your own web hosting plan directly. Use this guide to check with the current web hosting manager.
