## Objective

In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), you can increase the capacity of your [web hosting plans](/links/web/hosting). A subscription upgrade provides the following advantages:

- More powerful hosting
- More FTP storage space
- Additional databases
- Additional email accounts
- Additional features such as [mailing lists](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/mx_plan/feature_mailing_list) (from [the Professional offer](/links/web/hosting-professional-offer)) or the [Web Cloud Databases service](/links/web/databases){.external} (included in [the Performance offers](/links/web/hosting-performance-offer))

**This guide explains how to upgrade your OVHcloud hosting plan without any service interruptions.**

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud web hosting plan](/links/web/hosting)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) with the required permissions to manage the Web Hosting plan ([Administrator contact](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts))

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> **Before** making any changes to your current subscription, please check if you are affected by any of these questions:
>
> - [How do I get a temporary performance boost on my Performance hosting plan?](#boost)
> - [Will I lose the time remaining on my current hosting plan when I change plans?](#billing)
>

### Modifying your web hosting plan <a name="modify"></a>

> [!warning]
> Subscription switching to a lower plan is not available to our customers whose services are hosted in a data centre outside of Europe.
>
> If you would like to change your subscription to a lower plan, please follow the steps in our guide on "[Migrating your website and emails to OVHcloud](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/hosting_migrating_to_ovh)".
>

To modify your subscription, go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) in the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. Click `Hosting plans`{.action} and select the hosting plan concerned.

In the `Plan` box, click the `...`{.action} button to the right of `Solution`, then `Change plan`{.action}.

Then select your new subscription and its duration. Confirm the corresponding contracts, then click `Send`{.action}.

### Special cases

#### Temporarily boost your Performance hosting <a name="boost"></a>

With the [Boost option](/links/web/hosting-options-boost), available on our *Performance* plans, you can temporarily increase your web hosting plan’s CPU and RAM resources to absorb a one-off increase in traffic. If this increase continues over time, you can also [switch to the higher-level Performance plan](#modify) so that you have these resources permanently.

> [!warning]
>
> When you choose to enable the Boost option, it will remain active and billed **until you disable it**.

If the **Boost** option is right for you, please find instructions below on how to **enable** or **disable** this option on your web hosting plan.

> [!tabs]
> **Enable the Boost option**
>>
>> To enable the Boost option, log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) then go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. In the left-hand column, click `Hosting plans`{.action}, then select the Web Hosting plan concerned. In the `General information` box on the page that opens, click the `...`{.action} button to the right of `Boost`, then `Boost my hosting plan`{.action}.<br><br>

>> To disable the Boost option, log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) then go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. In the left-hand column, click `Hosting plans`{.action} , then select the Web Hosting plan concerned. On the page that pops up, go to the `More` tab, then click `Boost my hosting plan`{.action}.<br>

#### Billing when you change plans <a name="billing"></a>

When you upgrade your plan to a higher plan, a *pro rata* calculation will be applied until the next renewal date for this initial subscription.
This calculation is the price difference between your original plan and your new plan.

> **Example:**<br>
>
> You have subscribed to a [Personal](/links/web/hosting-personal-offer) subscription on 1 January 2024.
>
> On October 31, 2024, you upgrade this **Personal** plan to the [Pro](/links/web/hosting-professional-offer) plan.<br>
>
> Therefore, the amount corresponding to the remaining duration on the **Personal** subscription (2 months, from 01 November 2024 to 01 January 2025) is automatically deducted from the cost of the new **Pro** subscription, until 01 January 2025. You will only pay the difference.
> From 01 January 2025, the **Pro** subscription will then be billed at its current price.
