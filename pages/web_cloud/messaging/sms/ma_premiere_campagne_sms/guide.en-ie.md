### Step 1: Add contacts

#### Add a contact list

A contact list can be imported via a .csv or .txt file.

To add a contact list, click the `Contacts`{.action} tab, and then click `Create a contact list`{.action}.

With the following guide, you can find out how to [create a list of SMS recipients](/pages/web_cloud/messaging/sms/liste_de_destinataire_sms).

#### Add an address book

Unlike contact lists, address books contain contacts that you can name and more easily identify for targeted campaigns.

To add an address book, click the `Contacts`{.action} tab, then `Address book`{.action}.

Refer to our guide on [Managing SMS address books](/pages/web_cloud/messaging/sms/gerer_mes_carnets_dadresses_sms) to find out more.

### Step 2: Create a sender

By default, SMS messages from an OVHcloud account in France are sent from a short number, which enables recipients to reply back. You may want to create an alpha-numeric sender name via the `Senders`{.action} tab, so that your SMS messages are sent with your company or organisationâ€™s name.

To do this, you can refer to the [section on choosing an SMS sender, in our guide on sending SMS messages via the OVHcloud Control Panel.](/pages/web_cloud/messaging/sms/envoyer_des_sms_depuis_mon_espace_client#step-3-choose-an-sms-sender)

### Step 3: Sending an SMS campaign

In the `Message and Campaign`{.action} tab, you can access the sending options, the log of SMS messages sent and received, and scheduled SMS messages that are due to be sent in future.

Then compose your message, and choose between sending it immediately or sending it on schedule. If you choose to schedule your campaign, you will need to define the date and time of sending.
