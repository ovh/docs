### Manage your email account folders (left-hand column) <a name="folders-management"></a>

In this area, you will see the folders stored on your email account. You will find the **special** folders already there (in orange) and the folders you have **created** (in green).

![Zimbra - folders](images/zimbra-05.png){.thumbnail}

#### Special folders <a name="folders-specials"></a>

Special folders are created automatically by the email server, and they make up the main part of an email account.

> [!primary]
>
> If one of your contacts asks for a read receipt of an email, you will get the following standard message: `John has requested a read receipt for this email. Send a read receipt`.
>

#### Searching emails <a name="email-search"></a>

If you would like to find an email, use the search bar at the top of your interface. You can then do a **simple search** or an **advanced search**, as described in the tabs below:

> [!tabs]
> **Simple search**
>>
>> Enter the keyword(s) you would like to find in the search bar, and press `Enter` to confirm your search. The word or words will be highlighted in your results.
>>
>> > If you know where to search for your item, you can enter keywords ( **from**, **to**, **cc**, **subject**, etc.) followed by a colon (`:`) and search for the item in the search text box. For example, if you want to quickly find a sender, you can type "from:" and the email address you are looking for. Example: "from: address@example.com".
>>
>> ![Zimbra - simple search](images/zimbra-08.png){.thumbnail}
>>
> **Advanced search**
>>
>> For a more precise search, click the arrow symbol on the right-hand side of your search bar. You can then restrict your search to a folder, a time condition, the subject or body of the message, and much more.
>>

>>

### Write an email <a name="email-writing"></a>

To create a new email, click the `New Message`{.action} (1) button in the top left of your Zimbra window.

![Zimbra - write an email](images/zimbra-10.png){.thumbnail}

> [!tabs]
> **Header**
>>
>> The header allows you to fill in the following fields:
>>
>> - **From**: The address from which you send your email. By default, this is your account email address. You can change your sender address by clicking on the arrow to the right of your email address.

>> - **BCC**: Click `CC/BCC`{.action} to the right of `To`{.action} to display this field. Blind carbon copy is a recipient field that allows an email to be sent without other recipients seeing the person or people in **BCC**.<br>
>> - **Subject**: Email title, the first item visible on reception before opening the email.<br>
>> - `...`{.action}: Located to the right of the `From`{.action} field, it gives you access to 3 options:<br>

>>    - Click `Request Read Receipt` to request a read receipt from the recipient.<br>
>>    - The `Plain Text` feature will disable the HTML layout features of your email.<br>
>>
>> ![Zimbra - header](images/zimbra-11.png){.thumbnail}
>>
> **Email body**
>>
>> To compose the body of your email, there is an HTML toolbar at the bottom of your window. This will allow you to edit your emails with layout, directly via your browser. In addition, the `< >`{.action} button (on the far right of your toolbar) opens a window where you can paste an email that has been prewritten using an external tool.
>>
>> ![Zimbra - body](images/zimbra-12.png){.thumbnail}
>>

After you have written your email, before you click `Send`{.action}, you can attach an attachment to it by clicking the paperclip icon next to the `Send`{.action} button.

### Contacts <a name="contacts"></a>

Click `Contacts` in the top bar to access the address book. It is divided into **3 parts**:

- **(1) Folders** (left): In the address book, you can create folders to organize and group contacts.
- **(2) Contact list** (center): View the contacts in the selected address book or folder.
- **(3) Contact Properties** or **New Contact** (right): This window appears when a contact is selected or is being created. You can read or modify a contact's information there.

![Zimbra - contacts](images/zimbra-15.png){.thumbnail}

To create a new contact, click the `New Contact`{.action} button at the top of the left-hand column.

Fill the fields with the information of your contact. You can add an image to it by clicking the profile icon in the upper right of the form.

Then click `Save`{.action}.

![Zimbra - new contact](images/zimbra-16.png){.thumbnail}

#### Manage contact folders <a name="contacts-folders"></a>

As with emails, special contact folders are automatically created by the email server.

- **Contacts**: Contacts are stored in this folder by default.
- **Trash**: Deleted contacts are stored in this folder before they are permanently deleted.
- **Emailed Contacts**: The contacts you have exchanged with are saved in this folder.

You can create folders and subfolders. They can be used to organize contacts into subsets. This makes it easier to find a contact in a folder you have created, rather than in your entire address book.

To create a folder, click the `+ Add a folder`{.action} button at the bottom of the left-hand column.

You can also create a subfolder by right-clicking the folder you want, and then clicking `Create Subfolder`{.action}. The "Emailed Contacts" and "Trash" folders cannot contain subfolders.

To move a contact to one of the folders, select the contact in the middle column and then, in the contact window that appears on the right, click the `Move`{.action} button. Then select the folder you want to assign to the contact.

![Zimbra - contact folders](images/zimbra-17.png){.thumbnail}

> [!primary]
>
> When you create a contact from a selected folder, the contact will be automatically added to that folder.

#### List management <a name="contacts-lists"></a>

You can associate a contact with one or more lists. Lists are used to group contacts, so emails can be sent to all of the list members. For example, to send an email to a large number of regular recipients, simply add the name of your list as a recipient, instead of adding the contacts in a list one by one.

To create a list, click in the box labeled `New List` at the bottom of the left-hand column and type a name for your list.

To assign a contact to one of your lists, select the contact in the middle column, and then in the window that appears on the right, click `Assign to Lists`{.action}. Select the list(s) you want to assign to the contact. Alternatively, enter a new list name and click `Add`{.action}.

![Zimbra - lists](images/zimbra-list.png){.thumbnail}

#### Import Contacts / Export Contacts <a name="import-export"></a>

Select one of the following two tabs:

> [!tabs]
> **Import Contacts**
>>
>> In the `Contacts` window, right-click on the contacts folder of your choice, with the exception of the "Email contacts" and "Trash" folders, which do not allow contacts to be imported and exported.<br>
>>
>> Then click `Import`{.action} to open the import window. With the `Browse...` button, you can retrieve the file containing your contacts in the formats .csv or .vcf. <br><br>
>> ![Zimbra - Import](images/zimbra-19.png){.thumbnail}
>>
> **Export Contacts**
>>
>> In the `Contacts` window, right-click on the contacts folder of your choice, with the exception of the "Email contacts" and "Trash" folders, which do not allow contacts to be imported and exported.
>>
>> Then click `Export`{.action} to open the export window. Select the file type you want to export, and then click `Export`{.action}.<br><br>
>> ![Zimbra - Export](images/zimbra-20.png){.thumbnail}
>>

### Calendar <a name="calendar"></a>

Click on the `Calendar` icon in the top bar to access the address book. It is divided into **3 parts**:

- **(1) List of calendars** (left): Manage your different calendars and sub-calendars.
- **(2) Calendar Content** (center): View the content of selected calendars and sub-calendars.
- **(3) Task List** (right): Manage your tasks and task lists.

![Zimbra - calendar](images/zimbra-calendar-view.png){.thumbnail}

#### Calendar management <a name="calendar-management"></a>

By default, in the `My Calendars` list, you have a `Calendar` created by default. This default calendar cannot be deleted, but you will see that you can create your own calendars in the next paragraph.

##### 1 - Create a calendar <a name="calendar-add-calendar"></a>

- **(1)**: To create a calendar, move your cursor over `My Calendars` in the left-hand column and click the `+` button. Enter a name and colour, then click `Save`{.action}.

- **(2)**: Click on the time condition of your calendar in which you want to add an event. For a simple addition, simply define a title for the event and a location then click `Save`{.action}. To add more details about your event, click `Add more details`{.action}.

![Zimbra - calendar](images/zimbra-calendar-event-add-01.png){.thumbnail .w-400}

- **Start**: The date and time your event starts. If you tick `All day`, you will not have to enter a start and end time because the whole day will be taken into account.
- **End**: The end date and time of your event.
- **Repeat**: If this is a recurring event, define the frequency.
- **Location**: The location where the event will take place, such as the name of a meeting room.

- **Notes**: Message that will be sent to the event guests.
- **Remind**: Be notified before the event begins.
- **Show as**: Define if the event makes its guests available or unavailable during its progress.
- **Calendar**: Define the calendar associated with the event.

Once you have defined your event, click `Save`{.action}.

![Zimbra - calendar](images/zimbra-calendar-event-add-02.png){.thumbnail .w-400}

##### 3 - Edit an event <a name="calendar-modify-event"></a>

#### Tasks <a name="tasks"></a>

Tasks are items that are detached from your calendars. Their purpose is to list the tasks to be performed without attaching an execution date or a temporality to them. These tasks are complementary to calendars.

The "Tasks" list exists by default, it cannot be deleted, but you can create your own task lists.

- **(1)**: To create a task, click the `...`{.action} button, then `New task`{.action} or simply click the `+`{.action} button next to your task list.

- **(2)**: To create a new task list, click the `...`{.action} button, then click `Create List...`{.action}.

![Zimbra - calendar](images/zimbra-calendar-task-01.png){.thumbnail .w-400}

When you create a task, you can set a due date and priority so that you can rank them according to their importance, as well as a drop-down menu to select the corresponding task list.

Then click `Save`{.action} to finish creating your task.

![Zimbra - calendar](images/zimbra-calendar-task-02.png){.thumbnail .w-400}

### Filters <a name="filters"></a>

#### How to set filters <a name="filters-howto"></a>

Setting up filters on your email account is an important parameter that allows you to set up an automatic sorting system when your emails are received.

A filtering rule in Zimbra is made up of 4 elements:

1 - [Comparison field](#filters-comp-field): On which part of the email the filter will apply.<br>
2 - [Comparison operator](#filters-comp-operator): How precisely should the filter be applied.<br>
3 - [Value](#filters-value): Which words/elements of the email will be targeted by the filter.<br>
4 - [Filter Actions](#filters-action): What will the filter do on the email.<br>

![Zimbra - filters](images/zimbra-filters.png){.thumbnail}

> Example : If the **Subject (1)** field of the email **contains (2)** the word `invoice` **(3)**, then **Forward to (4)** `billing@example.com`.

In the following paragraphs, you will find the details of each of the elements of a filtering rule.

##### 1 - Comparison field <a name="filters-comp-field"></a>

The comparison field is the section of the email to check for the comparison operator. Comparison fields can include the following fields:

- **From**: Specify a sender in the “From” field of the email.
- **To**: Search for recipient names in the "To" field.
- **CC**: Search for copied recipient names in the “CC” field.
- **Subject**: Specify items in the subject of the email.
- **Header named**: When selected, an additional input field appears before the comparison operator. Use this field to enter any element of an email header. You can specify the standard fields "From", "To", "Subject", or other fields that may be present in the email header. For example, some email servers might add specific fields to the header that you can include in your filter rule, using this comparison field.
- **Body**: Refers to the words contained or not in the body of the email.

##### 2 - Comparison operator <a name="filters-comp-operator"></a>

Depending on the comparison field designated above, the comparison operator will determine the level of correspondence to be applied to the value.

> [!primary]
>
> The available comparison operators vary depending on the comparison field you have selected.

- **Matches exactly / Does not match exactly**: What you enter must match exactly.<br>
    *For example*, by indicating that the subject of the email corresponds exactly to “house”, the filter will only match with “house” and not with “houses” or “a blue house”.

- **Contains / Does not contain**: What you enter must be present in the field(s).<br>
    *For example*, by specifying that the subject of the email must contain “house”, the filter will match with “house”, “houses” and also “a blue house”.

- **Matches wildcard condition / Does not match wildcard condition**: Specifies that the subject must match the specified string, which includes wildcards.

- **Exists / Does not exist**: Specifies that the specified comparison field must exist or must not exist in the message. This comparison operator is used with the comparison fields named header.

> **Using wildcards in filters**
>
> Wildcards can be used in the input field for comparison using the comparison operator “**Matches wildcard condition / Does not match wildcard condition**”. The available wildcards are `*` and `?`.
>
> - The wildcard `*` is a placeholder for any number of characters of any type, including spaces.<br><br> For example, the search string “blue\*house” would return the matches “blue house”, “houses” or “blue wooden house”. However, it would not return "lightning blue house". <br><br> Another example: The search string "w\*house" would return the matches "white house" and "watch TV in your house". However, it would not return “watch TV in your house with a friend”.
>
> - The wildcard `?` is a placeholder for exactly one character.<br><br>For example, the search string “blue?house” would return the matches “blue house”, “blue-house” and “blue_house”.
>

##### 3 - Value <a name="filters-value"></a>

Once you have selected your field and comparison operator, you will need to enter the value they should match in the corresponding box.

##### 4 - Filter Actions <a name="filters-action"></a>

The `Then` field defines the action to be taken on the email that meets the filter conditions. Filter actions can include deleting, sorting, and even marking incoming mail.

- **Keep in the Inbox**: Saves emails to your inbox. If none of the filtering rules match an email, this action takes place by default.
- **Move to folder**: Moves the email to a specified folder.
- **Permanently delete**: Deletes the email message, not storing it in any of your folders including "Trash".
- **Forward To**: Forwards the email to the address you specify.
- **Mark as read**
- **Star**: Marks your email with a star.

#### Create a filter <a name="filters-creation"></a>

To create filters, click on the cogwheel icon in the top right-hand corner of your Zimbra interface, then click on `Settings`{.action}. Next, click on `Filters`{.action} in the left-hand column.

![Zimbra - create filter](images/zimbra-21.png){.thumbnail}

If filters exist, you will see the list in the order in which they are applied:

- **(1)** You can preview each filter by clicking the `...`{.action} button to the right of the filter and then clicking `Details`{.action}. The `Run`{.action} button launches the action set for this filter.

- **(2)** This button is used as a handle, allowing you to move the filter in the list to assign an order of application. Each filter is applied in the order that is defined in the list.

Click the `+ Add a filter`{.action} button to start creating it. The basic mode window appears by default. You can switch to advanced mode by clicking `Switch to advanced`{.action} to have all comparison operators. Find the details in the section “[How to set filters](#filters-howto)”.

- The `Send sample copy to me`{.action} button will send you a preview of this automatic reply in your inbox.
- `External Senders`: You can define a different message when the sender is external to your domain name and/or address book. By default, all senders receive the same message.
