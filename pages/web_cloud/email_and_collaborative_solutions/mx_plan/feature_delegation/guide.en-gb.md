## Objective <a name="objective"></a>

By creating a delegation, you can enable an email account user to manage their own features (e.g. changing passwords). These features depend on the type of delegation set up:

- Delegate **all of your email accounts** to one or more OVHcloud accounts. This type of delegation allows beneficiary customer accounts to manage filters, email auto-replies, redirections/aliases, and mailing lists.

- Delegate **one or more email accounts** and their filters to a single OVHcloud account. This type of delegation does not allow recipients to manage email auto-replies, redirections, or mailing lists. It also does not allow recipients to delete the relevant email account(s), import emails from another account or manage delegations.

**This guide explains how to delegate email accounts for your MX Plan solution.**

## Requirements

- an MX Plan solution, available as part of our [Web Hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/), the [100M free hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/free-web-hosting/), or ordered separately as a standalone solution
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

> [!warning]
>
> The following instructions are only eligible for the legacy MX Plan solution. For our current solution, there are no delegations. You can manage your password, filters and auto-replies for an email account directly via OWA (**O**utlook **W**eb **A**pp). **You can identify which version you are using with the table below.**
