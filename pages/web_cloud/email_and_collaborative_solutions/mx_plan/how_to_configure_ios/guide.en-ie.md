Select `IMAP` (recommended) or `POP`.<br><br>In the `INCOMING MAIL SERVER` and `OUTGOING MAIL SERVER` sections, despite the word "optional", enter: <br>- the hostname **ssl0.ovh.net** <br>- your **full email address** as username <br>- your email password|

At the end of the configuration process, ensure that you leave `Mail`{.action} ticked, so that the application can use this account, then click `Save`{.action}.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email using the Mail app on your device.

If you need to enter any settings manually in your account preferences, the technical settings you will need to use with our MX Plan solution are listed below:

- **for IMAP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|993|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465|

- **for POP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|995|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465|
