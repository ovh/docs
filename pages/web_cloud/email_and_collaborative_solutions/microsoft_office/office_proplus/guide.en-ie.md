**Learn how to install and use Microsoft 365 apps on a remote desktop (RDS) or shared computer.**

## Requirements

- a Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise licence (formerly: Office 365 ProPlus)

> [!warning]
>
> The Microsoft 365 Apps for business licence is incompatible with RDS and shared computer usage.
> 

## Instructions

This guide is based on the official Microsoft documentation: [Deploy Microsoft 365 Apps by using Remote Desktop Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/deployoffice/deploy-microsoft-365-apps-remote-desktop-services){.external}.

Installing a Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise solution on a shared computer using Remote Desktop Services (RDS) does not work without a specific configuration. Without this setting, you should get the following message:

> If you have already installed your Office 365 ProPlus licence, you will need to **uninstall** it.

- Once you have uninstalled your licence, please [click here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=49117){.external} to download the Microsoft 365 Deployment Tool.

- **Run** the deployment tool on your machine.

- Edit the `configuration.xml` file.

Edit the `configuration.xml` file, then uncomment the following lines:

```xml
Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="True"
Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1"
```

If these lines do not exist, you can copy and paste them into the file.

- Save the changes you have made. Then open a Powershell terminal and run the following two commands from the folder where the `configuration.xml` file is located:

```powershell
./setup.exe /download configuration.xml
```

```powershell
./setup.exe /configure configuration.xml
```

> These commands can take several minutes to complete.

- Open the Windows registry editor by running `Regedit`, then follow this path:

```powershell
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\Configuration
```

- Check the following key:

```powershell
SharedComputerLicensing
```

Make sure the value is `1`. If this key does not exist, you can create it.
