## Objective

You want to:

- Delete an email account you no longer use.
- Reset an email account to use it with a new email address.
- Reset an email account in order to cancel it.

**This guide explains how to delete or reset an email account of your email solution.**

## Requirements

- A preconfigured OVHcloud email solution, such as [**Hosted Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/hosted-exchange/), [**Email Pro**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/email-pro/)) or **MX Plan** (available with a [web hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/), a [100M free hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/free-web-hosting/), or ordered separately)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) as the Admin contact of the email service concerned (section `Web Cloud`{.action})

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

OVHcloud offers 3 email solutions, and the concept of account deletion differs depending on which email solution you choose.

- **MX Plan**: This offer contains a certain number of email accounts as a bundle. When you delete an account, you free up an account "slot" of the email service.
- **Email Pro** and **Hosted Exchange**: Each of these offers consist of the service itself and individually billed email accounts. If you want to delete an email account, you will need to **reset** it. Once you have reset your email account, you can use this account again to create a new email address. You can also [cancel the subscription](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/microsoft_exchange/manage_billing_exchange#deleting-accounts) for this account if you wish to permanently delete it.
