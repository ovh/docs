## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve your Email Pro account information <a name="step1"></a>

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie){.external} then go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. In the left-hand column, click `Professionnal emails`{.action} then choose the Email Pro platform where you want to configure your email address.

On the new page, click the `Email accounts`{.action} tab.

Get the name of the Email Pro server that appears below the `Webmail`{.action} entry. In our example shown above, it is `proX.mail.ovh.net`.

> [!warning]
>
> Make sure to retrieve the **correct name** of the Email Pro server where the email address you want to configure is located. It may vary depending on the duration of your Email Pro solution (pro1.mail.ovh.net, pro2.mail.ovh.net, etc.).
> 

In the `Email accounts`{.action} tab of your *Email Pro* platform, a table will be displayed with your Email Pro address(es).

If you no longer remember the password to access the email address you want to configure, you can change it using the `...`{.action} button located on the same line to the right of the email account.

Then select `Edit`{.action}, choose a new password and confirm it. Then click `Next`{.action} and `Validate`{.action} in the second window.

The password change will be processed within the next 15 minutes approximately.

> [!warning]
>
> If you change the password for your email address and it is already used by another device (email software, computer, tablet, smartphone, photocopier, etc.), you will need to update the password on these other devices.
> They will no longer be able to log in to your email address using the old password.
>

At the end of this first step, you must now have the following information:

- the name of the Email Pro server (pro1.mail.ovh.net, pro2.mail.ovh.net, etc.)
- the email address to configure
- the password of the email address to be configured.

### Step 2: set up your address on Android via the Microsoft Outlook application <a name="step2"></a>

Launch the Microsoft Outlook app on your Android device. If you haven't already installed it, download it from the *Google Play Store*.

Once opened, click on `Add Account`{.action}, enter your full email address in the field labelled `Enter your email`{.action} and click `Continue`{.action}.

At the bottom of your screen, you will see two configuration choices: `IMAP`{.action} and `POP3`{.action}.

> [!success]
>
> With the **IMAP** synchronisation protocol, you can retrieve an “image” of the emails stored in your Email Pro address on the server side, and view them in your Microsoft Outlook application. **without** deleting the email from the Email Pro server where your email address is located. This protocol is very useful especially if you have several devices configured with your email address.
>
> The **POP3** protocol will, by default, retrieve the email received on the Email Pro server where your email address is located and keep it in the application/software configured with it. As a result, the email is no longer present on the Email Pro server, only on the device configured with your email address via the POP protocol.
> This protocol is not recommended if you have several devices configured with your email address. The email will only appear on one of the devices configured in **POP3** and not on all of the devices configured with your email address.
>
> However and despite the **POP3** configuration, some email software/applications still return a copy of the email to the server where your email address is located. This copy may remain temporarily or permanently.
> To find out if your application / software applies this method, contact the software publisher directly.
