### POP, IMAP and SMTP settings

When you choose your account type, we recommend using **IMAP** to receive emails. However, you can select **POP**. To understand how they work, see our section ["POP or IMAP, what is the difference?"](#popimap)

- **POP configuration**

| Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the **full** email address |
| Password | Enter the password for the email address |
| Server | pro**?**.mail.ovh.net (replace "**?**" with your server number) |
| Port | 995 |
| Security type | SSL/TLS |

- **IMAP configuration**

| Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the **full** email address |
| Password | Enter the password for the email address |
| Server | pro**?**.mail.ovh.net (replace "**?**" with your server number) |
| Port | 993 |
| Security type | SSL/TLS |

For sending emails, if you need to enter the **SMTP** settings manually in the account preferences,
you will find the settings below to use:

- **SMTP configuration**

| Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the **full** email address |
| Password | Enter the password for the email address |
| Server | pro**?**.mail.ovh.net (replace "**?**" with your server number) |
| Port | 587 |
| Security type | STARTTLS |

### POP or IMAP, what's the difference? <a name="popimap"></a>

When you set up your email address manually, your email client asks if you want to use **POP** (**P**ost **O**ffice **P**rotocol) or **IMAP** (**I**nternet **M**essage **A**ccess **P**rotocol). To understand this properly, you will need to configure your email address to include POP and IMAP protocols.

When you configure your mail client, you must enter the information from the **incoming server** to receive the emails, and the **outgoing server** to send the emails. To send emails, there is no choice, the **SMTP** (**S**imple **M**ail **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) is used. For the reception, you will have the choice between **POP** or **IMAP**.

![emailpro](images/popimap-01.png){.thumbnail}

To understand the difference between POP and IMAP, we will break down the elements that make up the processing of your incoming emails:

1. **Your device**: A computer, smartphone or tablet.

2. **Your email client**: Software or application dedicated to managing your emails. Your choice will determine the level of usability and functionality you will need to view your emails.

3. **The receiving protocol**: A choice that determines how you check emails on your device. This affects other devices that access the same email account.
    - **IMAP**: Your email client queries the email server and downloads the emails to your device. When you view an unread email, the server marks it as “read” by default. Other devices configured in IMAP will be able to check this status and view this email until it has been deleted on one of the devices.
    - **POP**: Your email client requests the email server and downloads the emails to your device. By default, once the email is downloaded to your device, the message is deleted from the server. As a result, other devices connected to this email address will not be able to view this email.

>
> This description is a summary, it represents the standard operation of these two protocols. You can configure the POP so that emails are not deleted when you check your emails. The goal here is to describe how these two protocols work natively and avoid any additional steps to match your needs.
