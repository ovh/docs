To delete an account within your Email Pro service, you will need to cancel it by changing its renewal configuration to **None**. To do this, go to the step ["Modifying the renewal frequency for your accounts"](#periodicity).

Once you have cancelled it, the account will be suspended on its expiry date. If you would like to delete the email address hosted by the account before its expiry date, you can reset it.

Go to the `Email accounts`{.action} tab of your service, then click on the `...`{.action} button next to the account concerned. Next, click `Reset this account`{.action}. Once you have reset the account, it will remain empty until its expiry date.
