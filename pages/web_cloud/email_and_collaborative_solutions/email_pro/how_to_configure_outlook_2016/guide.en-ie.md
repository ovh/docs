### Using your email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive emails.

OVHcloud also has a web application you can use to access your email address from your browser. You can access this application at <https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/>. You can log in using your email credentials. If you have any questions about how to use this interface, please refer to our guide on [Using the Outlook Web App](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/using_the_outlook_web_app_webmail/email_owa).

### Retrieving a backup of your email address

If you need to make a change that could lead to the loss of your email account data, we advise you to make a backup of the email account concerned beforehand. To do this, please read the "**Exporting from Windows**" section in our guide on [Migrating your email address manually](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/migrating/manual_email_migration#exporting-from-windows).

### Modifying existing settings

If your email account has already been set up and you need to access the account settings to change them:

- Go to `File`{.action} **(1)** from the menu bar at the top of your screen, then select the account you want to modify in the drop-down menu.
- Click `Account Settings`{.action} **(2)** below.
- Click `Server Settings`{.action} **(3)** to access the settings window.
