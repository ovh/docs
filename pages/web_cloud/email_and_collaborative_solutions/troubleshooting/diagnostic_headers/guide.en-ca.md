## Objective

The role of an email header is to trace the path taken by an email on the network, from the sender to the recipient.<br>
You can use it to identify malicious emails or detect slow reception.

Every email you receive has a header but it is not displayed by default when you view your email. You can however retrieve the header from your email client or webmail.

You can also export the entire email as a `.eml` file. This file may be requested to scan a malicious email you received.<br>
To retrieve a `.eml` file, go to the [Webmail](#webmail) section below.

**This guide explains how to retrieve an email header from your email client.**

## Requirements

- An email address using one of our [OVHcloud email solutions](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr-ca/emails/), or an external solution
- Access to your email address via webmail or an email client

## Instructions

### Understanding the content of a header

The header is composed of several elements indicating the path of the email. These are arranged in reverse chronological order, from the newest to the oldest entry, followed by additional information.<br>
Below is a non-exhaustive list of the elements that can make up a header, along with their meaning. 

- The `Received` field is present in the header each time the email is sent to an outgoing server (SMTP). The host name of the server is usually found with its IP address and a timestamp. The `Received` fields are sorted from the most recent pass to the oldest pass on a server:
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
Received: from mxplan7.mail.ovh.net (unknown [10.109.143.250])
	by mo3005.mail-out.ovh.net (Postfix) with ESMTPS id 448F4140309
	for &lt;john@mydomain.ovh&gt; ;Wed, 30 Jun 2021 13:12:40 +0000 (UTC)
</code></pre>
  *Here the email was sent from server mxplan7.mail.ovh.net to server mo3005.mail-out.ovh.net on 30 June 2021 at 13:12:40 (time zone UTC).*

- The `Return-Path` field corresponds to the return address when the message failed to be sent. The return address is usually the one that sent the email. 
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
Return-Path: &lt;john@mydomain.ovh&gt;
</code></pre>

- The `From` field indicates the email sender address and display name.
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
From: John &lt;john@mydomain.ovh&gt;
</code></pre>

- The `To` field indicates the email recipient address and display name.
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
To: Robert &lt;robert@hisdomain.ovh&gt;
</code></pre>

- The `Subject` field is the subject of the email.
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
Subject: Hello my friend
</code></pre>

- The `Message-ID` field designates the unique identifier of the email and ends with the name of the outgoing server (after the "@"). 
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
Message-ID: &lt;Dc55+mK3j7hdZkf5_r-ff=fjq380ozc2h5@mailserver.domain.ovh&gt;
</code></pre>

- The `Received-SPF` field displays the result of the [SPF](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_spf) check performed on the sender's domain name. You can use the `client-ip` argument to find the IP address of the server that sent the email. 
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
Received-SPF: Pass (mailfrom) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=000.11.222.33; helo=mail-smtp-001.domain.ovh; envelope-from=john@mydomain.ovh; receiver=robert@hisdomain.ovh
</code></pre>

- The `X-` fields are custom fields. They serve as complements to the standard fields. They are implemented by the servers that the emails pass through.
<pre class="bgwhite"><code>
X-OVH-Remote: 000.11.222.33 (mail-smtp-001.domain.ovh)
X-Ovh-Tracer-Id: 1234567891011121314
X-VR-SPAMSTATE: OK
X-VR-SPAMSCORE: 0
X-VR-SPAMCAUSE: 
</code></pre>
