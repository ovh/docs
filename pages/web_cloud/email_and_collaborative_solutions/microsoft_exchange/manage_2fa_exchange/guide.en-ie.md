## Objective

If you wish to increase the security on your Exchange account, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This will generate a random code that must be entered when you log in, in addition to your password. This code is generated using a one-time password (OTP) app, which must be installed on your smartphone or tablet.

**This guide explains how to enable two-factor authentication on your Exchange account.**

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Exchange solution](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/hosted-exchange/) already set up
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie)
- an OTP mobile application installed on your Android or iOS smartphone or tablet

> [!primary]
>**OTP mobile applications**
>
> You can choose from a number of OTP applications. Here are two examples that are free to use.
> 
> - For Android: Free OTP
> - For iOS: OTP Auth

#### Step 2: Enable two-factor authentication on an account

After enabling two-factor authentication on the Exchange service, you can then enable it on each one of your accounts.

To link the Exchange account to your OTP app, log in to your [webmail](https://www.ovh.ie/mail/).

At the first attempt to log in, a QR code will appear. Use your OTP app to scan it, then enter the code that the app generates to log in.

When you next log in, webmail will only ask for the code generated by the app.

Select the option that you need according to the table below:
