### Using your email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive emails.

Your Exchange email address and all of its collaborative features are also available via the [OWA interface](https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/). If you have any questions about how to use this interface, please refer to our guide on [Using the Outlook Web App](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/using_the_outlook_web_app_webmail/email_owa).

### Retrieving a backup of your email address

If you need to make a change that could lead to the loss of your email account data, we advise you to make a backup of the email account concerned beforehand. To do this, please read the “**Exporting**” part of the “**Thunderbird**” section in our guide on [Manually migrating an email address](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/migrating/manual_email_migration#exporting).
