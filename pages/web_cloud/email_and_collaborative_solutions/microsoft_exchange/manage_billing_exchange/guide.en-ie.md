In this new window, you can view and modify the billing for each of your accounts. You can make changes via the **Renewal** column for one or more accounts at once. Each modification on an account will be applied on the date listed in the **Expiry** column. 

In the example below, you will see the actions you need to take in order to set an account to monthly renewal:

> In the first step, click **Monthly** to the right of the account, then click `Next`{.action}.
>
> In the second step, you will see a summary listing the change that has been applied. Click `Send`{.action} on the bottom left.

#### Deleting accounts

To delete an account on your Hosted Exchange platform, you will need to cancel it by setting its renewal configuration to **Cancel on expiry**. To do this, refer to the step on [changing the renewal frequency for your accounts](./#change-the-renewal-frequency-for-your-accounts){.external}.

Once you have cancelled it, the account will be suspended on its expiry date. If you would like to delete the email address hosted by the account before its expiry date, you can reset it.

Go to the `Email accounts`{.action} tab for your platform, then click `...`{.action} next to the account concerned. Finally, click `Reset`{.action}. Once you have reset the account, it will remain empty until its expiry date.
