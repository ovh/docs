### How to add your email account <a name="addaccount"></a>

> In our examples, we use the server name "ex**?**.mail.ovh.ca". You will need to replace the “?” with the number designating the server of your Exchange service.
>
> You can find this number in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager). In the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, open `Microsoft`{.action} and then `Exchange`{.action}. The server name is visible in the **Connection** box in the `General Information`{.action} tab.

On your device’s homepage, open the `Gmail`{.action} app.
