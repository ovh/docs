title: 'Managed databases EOL policy'
updated: 2023-03-07

## Objective

OVHcloud managed databases offer several Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Each version of this software reaches, at one time or another, its end of sale and then its end of support. It can then be updated by our services or cease to function ("end of life"). Here, we want you to understand the lifecycle of OVHcloud managed databases, so that you can better anticipate and prepare for their evolutions.

**Discover the end-of-life policy for databases managed by OVHcloud.**

## Requirements

At least one of the following 3 solutions:

- One of the included databases with a [Web Hosting plan](/links/web/hosting).
- A [Web Cloud Databases instance](https://www.ovh.ie/cloud-databases/){.external} (included in a [Performance Web Hosting](/links/web/hosting) offer).
- A [Start SQL](/links/web/hosting-options-startsql) database pack.

## Instructions

### Covered products

The products covered by this end-of-life policy are:

- Web Cloud Databases Web Hosting services (also known as Private SQL services), dedicated DBMS instances that can be reached via the Web Hosting network ([see announcements](/pages/web_cloud/web_cloud_databases/clouddb-eos-eol)).

### Definitions and guidelines for the end-of-life policy

EOL = End Of Life

#### End of Life Announcement (EOL)

It is the publication of the end of sales and end of support dates. In general, OVHcloud will respect a 90-day period between the announcement of an end-of-life and its application.

#### End of Sale

The product concerned can no longer be ordered after this date. As previously announced, this rule applies at least 90 days after the end-of-life announcement.

#### End of Support

The date until which the customer can receive support for the product under the terms of the service contract or the general terms of the guarantee.
After this date, the product is no longer supported and is considered obsolete.
It applies at least 6 months after end of life announcement.

#### Period of obsolescence

It occurs after the end of support.

When an OVHcloud managed database service becomes obsolete, it can enter in both of the cases listed below.
As there may be consequences for your service, you will be sent an email notification at least one month before the obsolescence period.

**Service major update**

Your service remains active, and we are updating its DBMS to a new major version.
This type of update may cause unwanted behaviour on your applications. This is why we advise customers to be aware of their database version changes and not to wait for the support to finish.

**Termination of service**

Instead of updating your service's DBMS to the next available major release, we may decide to discontinue the service for several reasons, such as:

- Updating is not recommended by the DBMS publisher.

- Development on the DBMS has ended.

Termination can be done in two ways:

- We will stop renewing the service. In this case, the service will be suspended at the end of the commitment period.

- We will suspend the service and repay you the surplus paid.
