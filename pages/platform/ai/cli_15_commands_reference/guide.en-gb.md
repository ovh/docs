## Objective

This guide covers the usage of the **ovhai** CLI.

## Requirements

-   a working `ovhai` CLI [how to install ovhai CLI](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/ai/cli/install-client)

## Instructions

### Run a job

To submit a job you need a **docker image** and optionally some **data**.

First let's submit a simple job, a public ubuntu image which executes a command `echo`:

``` {.console}
ovhai job run ubuntu --gpu 1 -- echo "Hello from my first job"
```

> [!primary]
> * Add the flag `--help` to get more information about a command.
> * You can increase the number of GPUs with the flag `--gpu <x>` or choose to use CPUs with the flag `--cpu <x>`.

You can then list your current and old jobs with:

``` {.console}
ovhai job list
```

> [!primary]
> * Add the flag `--watch` to watch changes in live.
> * Most commands handle the flag `--output <format>` if you want a different output (JSON or YAML)

You should see the job you just ran, you need its `ID` to get more information about it.

To see information about a job use the following command:

``` {.console}
ovhai job get <job-id>
```

To see its logs in live use the following command:

``` {.console}
ovhai job logs <job-id> --follow
```

You should see the output of the `echo` command:
> Hello from my first job

### Use data in your job

You can upload data to the Object Storage and mount that data when you run a job. If you mount that data with read/write it will be saved to the Object Storage when the job ends.

Let's upload some data and use it in a job that will produce more data.

``` {.console}
ovhai data upload <region> <container> some-file.txt
```

> [!primary]
> * If you already used the Swift CLI, the commands are similar.

Now that you have some data in a container you can mount it when you run a job with the flag `--volume`.

``` {.console}
ovhai job run <image> --volume <container>@<region>:/data:rw
```

> [!primary]
> * You can use the flag `--volume` more than one time if you want to mount more containers.
> * Mounted containers with write access are only synchronized when the job is terminated.

You can list and download data you uploaded or generated by a job with:

``` {.console}
ovhai data list <region> <container>
ovhai data download <region> <container> --prefix /some-data
```

### Synchronize data while a job is running

You can synchronize data to the Object Storage while a job is running with:

``` {.console}
ovhai job push-data <job-id>
```

You can see the progress with:

``` {.console}
ovhai job get <job-id>
```

### Execute commands inside a running job

You can execute commands (like `bash`) while a job is running.

``` {.console}
ovhai job exec -it <id> -- bash
```

This way you can interact with a running job.

### Run a job with ssh access

You can create a job with some ssh access:

``` {.console}
ovhai job run -s ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ovhcom/ai-training-fastai
```

Multiple `-s` arguments can be used to provide multiple SSH public keys.

Once the job is in `RUNNING` state, you can retrieve the `sshUrl` with:

``` {.console}
ovhai job get <job-id>

```

Then you can connect to it with a terminal:

``` {.console}
ssh 0d916855-1cd4-4b66-8803-b4782bc13902@gra.training.ai.cloud.ovh.net -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Manage registries

You can list available registries with:

``` {.console}
ovhai registry list
```

By default, you have access to public registries, and a shared registry scoped to your project.
To add a private registry, use:

``` {.console}
ovhai registry add <url>
```

You will be asked to type your credentials.

### Switch region in the CLI

The regions available to install and use the `ovhai` CLI are `GRA` and `BHS`. If you want to change the region in the CLI, you can use the following commands.

You can list the **Names** and **URLs** of the available regions with:

``` {.console}
ovhai config list
```

> [!primary]
> The region in **green** is the one you are currently in.
>

To change the region, use:

``` {.console}
ovhai config set <region>
```

> [!primary]
> `<region>` is the new region name (`GRA` or `BHS`), in which you want to be placed.
