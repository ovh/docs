## Smart Grids
Smart Grids are an initiative to connect buildings, cities, and infrastructure to automate and optimize energy production, traffic flows, etc.


### Smart buildings

### Smart Cities

## The Metrics value for Smart Grids

Metrics platform has key features to help you store and analyze the data from the IoT world:

- Computation is done server-side, your devices can get only the needed result of a query.
- Storing data from thousands of sensors is only a few euros.
- In the Warp 10™ protocol, both space (location) and time are considered first class citizens. Complex searches like “find all the sensors active during last Monday in the perimeter delimited by this geo-fencing polygon” can be easily done
- Security is handled by tokens, so you can hardcode the token into every devices.
