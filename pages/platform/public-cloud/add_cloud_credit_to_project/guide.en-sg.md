## Objective

With the *cloud credit* option you can allocate a specific amount to your Public Cloud project which will serve as the default payment method for the [billing of the project](../information-on-cloud-billing-options/).<br> This means that cloud credit is debited first and any outstanding amount will be then be paid by other available payment methods. (Please consult the [Public Cloud billing guides](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/billing/) to learn more about this topic.)

**This guide explains how to add credit on to your Public Cloud account using a voucher, or by generating a purchase order.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
