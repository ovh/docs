## Objective

By default, the number of resources (RAM, CPU, disk space, number of instances, etc.) and projects you can create is limited.

To create more resources and projects, you need to increase your quota. 

**Find out how to do so by following this guide.**


## Requirements

- a registered payment method
- a maximum number of projects used on your OVHcloud account

## Instructions

To request for an increase in the number of projects and/or quotas for a project, you will need to contact the support team.

To do this, select your project, then go to the `Quota and Localisation`{.action} section. You will then see your project’s current quotas.

Next, click `Increase your quota!`{.action}.
