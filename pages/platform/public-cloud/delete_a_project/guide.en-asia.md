## Objective

When you no longer need your [Public Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/public-cloud/) project, you can delete it from the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia).

When you delete your Public Cloud project, a final invoice is issued for the outstanding amount.

Please note that deleting a project is not the same as deactivating your Public Cloud instances. When you delete a project, the resources contained in it will be permanently lost. This action can not be undone.
