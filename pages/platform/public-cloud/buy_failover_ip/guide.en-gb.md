## Objective

You may need to configure a failover IP address on your instances for different reasons. For example, you may be:

- hosting several websites on your instance
- hosting international projects

To meet these needs, you can order a failover IP address for your Public Cloud instances.

These failover IP addresses can only be migrated to instances in the same project.

This guide explains how to buy a failover IP for an OVHcloud Public Cloud project.


## Requirements
- at least one instance (please refer to our guide on [Creating an instance in the OVHcloud Control Panel](../create_an_instance_in_your_ovh_customer_account/))

## Instructions

First of all, click on the `Failover IP`{.action} menu in the OVHcloud Public Cloud Control Panel, then click `Buy failover IPs`{.action} in the actions list:

The following page will then open:

Enter the following information:

* The number of failover IPs you want to order (IP blocks are not currently available).
* The instance on which the IPs will be routed.
* The location of the IPs.

You will also need to accept the General Terms and Conditions of Service.

They are available in the following locations in Europe:
